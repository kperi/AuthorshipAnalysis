Daway, what's your input/output of your model?
can you give me some examples of your labels?
your output has no %?
no probability
k
can you change your model to process image?
or music scroll?
like Morzat
ok
i will think about what other applications
this time, you need save a good copy /recording of your mode, next year, you can submit those code for your internship job hunting
k
i love you, my dear
DoDo, how are you?
ACT?
did you rinse it yet?
brush your teeth gently
and have the tooth paste stay in your mouth at least for 2 min
does the mouthwash provide some relief?
rinse for a good 2 min
after meal

i make a dentist appointment for you on 8/5 1PM, but you need to go to airport at 8PM that evening
so if your teeth needs some work, need to do it in Taiwan
so the best advice is to really take a good care NOW
apply tooth paste on your gum when you go to bed
that really help
try it. i do that, and grandma do that,.. many of my friends do that - apply the tooth paste on your gum!
DoDo, you haven't go to bed, or you woke up early?
Be nice to your mom. Share your life with your mom.
it's the people who stays connected with you in life matters, not the travelling matters
i am going to bed now. Write me emails
DoDo, what do you do today?
the weather is really nice at Princeton today
My Dear DoDo
how are you?
how is your model?
no. i want to stay connected with you
Sigh. Ok. No matter where you are, talk to your mother.
It's your relationship with your family brings you happiness
Also, get to know your mentor and other professors a bit more. talk to them about their view, research...
i am going to bed now. I love you. stay healthy.
love you. good night
Big hug and kiss kiss. Have ambitions and learn.
My Dear DoDo, you up?
Just miss you. Want to see if you make the best out from the last 10 days on research. Love you.
