going to paris? yeah
#regretz
she was so pretty
her name was tabitha
and she was a tabby cat
what the name?
i thought it was cute
she looked more like a melissa to be honest
lolllll
omg
no i don't know if i would do that actually
cats are regal
i wouldn't want to make him ridiculous
hannah just means grace
originally hebrew if i recall correctly

well maggie has double legacy here. she is quite smart but i don't know if she would have gotten in otherwise
and mark's parents both work for princeton. but he's also very very smart and an excellent coder. mark and maggie will both probably be more successful than i anyway
just go to your room and turn off your light
dawei doesn't translate to david well
david means beloved
why don't you spell your name dawei
oh i forget you hate your culture
m not really
it's pretty clearly a chinese name
if i had been a boy i would've been named samuel
really?
"davay" = come on! according to google translate
doesn't sound russian
do they even have the soft w sound?
my parents were also going to name me isabella
actually they gave my sister the choice
to name me either haley or hannah
and she chose hannah
because she thought it was uglier
she also asked when i was going back to the hospital
my mom was a cheerleader in high school
yo being a cheerleader would be fun
haha awwwww
it would be so fun to be a flyer
the ones who get thrown up in the air
obviously not
but i don't have any of the necessary skills
my uncle bill was a cheerleader actually!!
of course you have a problem with the philosophy behind it
ha
what english words?
how do you have real chinese friends >.<
who do you know
real chinese people
besides your relatives
i dunno how it would work with english words because the "er" changes the sound of the word to a considerable extent
bian and biar really don't sound that much alike
it would be like instead of saying "when" saying "warrr"
when-errrr
but that's not what you do in chinese
cat-errrr
