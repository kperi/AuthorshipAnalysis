Yes or unpinned them
An argument is one event with two or more involved (linked) subjects
People should not be events
He should be entered as a regular entity 
"Yes, but if u look at tabs the male and female can be events or other entity types"
There are tabs above the icons
No I would only make incidents events
Make people standard entities and link them to events
Regular entities don't appear in squares 
U only see the icon
