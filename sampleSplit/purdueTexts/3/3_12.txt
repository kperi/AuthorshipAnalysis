Let's shoot for tomorrow
amber is going to her dads so I am free most of the day.
Her biological dad out in hyde park area
Hey we r heading out to eat in Chicago tonight with another couple then to sandtrap Mines afterwards for dancing and hanging out (imagine a swing/big band club from back in the day with young and old out dancing). Wondering if u guys wanted to join us?
"Sounds good. We don't plan on eating in Chicago till 7:45pm, so we plan on leaving around 6:30pm. Not sure where we r eating yet (the other couple is choosing), sandtrap Mines is a $20 admission per person and we intend to hang out late"
Oh ok no prob
Remind her about sleep substitutes such as Red Bull and coke :P
Haha nice
