Enjoying some time together without spanish homework interrupting ;)
So u heard about new brewery yet?
"Yup, we should go there sometime"
Sounds good
Cool
Tutoring till 8:30pm or so. Why?
"Yeah I think so, gotta check budget tho. birthday weekend, so it's tight"
Sounds good
"Hey what about coming over to my place and drinking beer there? It's free.... And, we have weed"
"K I should be done with tutoring around 8:30, hit me up around then or vice versa"
