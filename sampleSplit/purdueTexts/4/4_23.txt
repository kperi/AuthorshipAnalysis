You in Chicago?
"Me too, I'm near the corner of Jackson and Dearborn "
What u up to?
On the corner of Madison?
How long will u be there?
It would take me that to walk there
Sounds good walking in that direction
In Chicago
Taking my little bro to the zoo and to see the city
"I should be home, just gotta do he"
