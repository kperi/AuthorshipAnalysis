
      The rights, especially the right to marriage, of homosexuals is one of the most controversial social topics of the last few years and the debate has been heated. One of the main contributors to the conversation, the media, from news to television to movies, has presented homosexuals with certain bias. The gays of America are commonly depicted as very flamboyant and ostentatious, both in dress and in personality. They are also usually represented as effeminate or masculine, whichever is the opposite of their specific gender role. In addition to these relatively neutral stereotypes, some media pundits will decry homosexuals on desanctifying American family values (when discussing homosexual rights of marriage and adoption) while others portray them as very good parents, one of the more mainstream examples being a TV show called Modern Family. However, even socially supportive media such as Modern Family still depict homosexuals as flamboyant and ostentatious.
      This near uniform portrayal of homosexuals in our media is very prejudiced and stereotypes gays. Although there are certainly flamboyant and ostentatious gays, just as there would be flamboyant and ostentatious people in any group of people, these people are certainly the "vocal minority", and such stereotypes are not fair to the general gay community. There are, however, as previously touched upon, some positive aspects in recent media history that support homosexuals in America. Unlike 50 to 60 years ago, when being openly homosexual could and would land you (involuntarily) into a mental institution, as it was regarded as a mental disorder, today gays are encouraged to "come out" and not hide their true sexual orientations. Although our society, and our media, is still very prejudiced toward homosexuals, we have certainly come along way from seeing them as mentally unbalanced.
