One of the most popular classes at my gym is a STEP class every Saturday morning. The floor is always packed with members with their platforms. Everyone's face fills with the anticipation of a treat.

The little platform used in the STEP class is about three feet long and one foot wide, with two squares underneath forming a base and adding another four inches in height.  We are to follow the instructor to move up and down on the platform. Depending on the direction you step up and down on the platform, and the direction you turn, toward or away from the platform, plus the combination of which foot you use, and the sequence of ups and downs, you can create all sorts of combinations. Each move has a specific name. You can do an "around of world", or "over the top", "L-step", "scissors", "A-step", or a "hamstring curl". Amazingly, after a string of moves, a beautiful choreography, almost dance-like performance is created, and most importantly, there are no breaks. Quickly, everyone becomes sweaty with fastened heartbeat but no one stops.

The high-energy atmosphere and music really boost up the mood. Of course, the endorphins from all the exercise help too. To me, it is really like playing the piano. During my first couple STEP classes, I had to concentrate very hard, without even blinking my eyes so I would not miss any moves of my instructor. It was just as if I was playing a new piano song for the first time and I had to follow each note carefully.

Then, after I learned the terminology and the moves of STEP, it was as if I had finally memorized the song and could totally enjoy the joys of the repetitive coordination. And yet, my mind still has to be fixated on my movement so I won't mess up the rhythm. In the end, I am an exuberant being with big happy smile on my face, and I am already longing for my next STEP class.
