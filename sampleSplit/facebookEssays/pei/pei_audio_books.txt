I parked my car and stopped the engine, but I was not going to step out of my car to my office, at least not until the tears dried out a bit.  I needed time to pull myself back to the reality from the world I was just in, from the world of Steve Jobs as depicted in his last chapter of fighting cancer, or from the odyssey of Louis Zamperini who went from being an Olympics athlete to surviving the Japan's prison camp during World War II.

It is hard to explain how I can be transformed into worlds so remote by an audio book while driving on a busy highway, where everyone else drives at around eighty miles per hour.  I guess we always underestimate people's reflectiveness. But it is those stories that make driving bearable.  The stories actually make me want to hop in my car.

The interesting thing about the tears that come from reading books is that these tears always come unconsciously. I usually do not even realize I was crying. It is always the water-drops on the book pages that startle me. Did the water drop from the ceiling?  No, it was my tears. Crying from listening to the audio books is also from my subconscious and it is harder to handle when I am driving.  Suddenly, the eyeglasses become foggy but I did not want to stop the audiotape nor the car, I just wanted to continue to hear the story. Even when I eventually have to step out of my car and continue my day, knowing that somewhere in the world, another story is waiting. I am content with the thought.
