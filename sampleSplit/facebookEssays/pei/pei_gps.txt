I regretted not picking up area map when it was offered by the auto rental office. After circling around Route 470 for thirty minutes, I was lost in some rural area outside Denver on a misty, snowy day in early March.

I was heading back to the Denver International Airport after concluding a successful business meeting. The airport should have been within twenty miles and I had a plane to catch in two hours. At first, I was not alarmed when the GPS led me to a deserted field.  The Denver airport is indeed located in a faraway area from their business and residential districts. But when I saw that the estimated arrival time was five hours and that Kansas City appeared on the screen, I knew something was not quite right. Apparently the GPS went hay-wire and did not get back to function even after several reset.

Disregarding the images of the horrible crime scenes from TV dramas, I finally parked the car at an intersection and went out the car to wave a truck driver to stop.  That truck was the first vehicle I ran across in the ten minutes. The dark muscular truck driver looked at me in disbelief – an Asian woman trembling in the cold asking for directions. I must have had looked ridiculous underdressed in my business suit on that snowy spring day with gusty winds reaching forty miles an hour.  It was not just the GPS that played a trick; the weather also dropped forty degrees in one day. It might have be the clinking sound from my quivering teeth which woke up the truck driver from being startled by the absurd scene. The driver gave me the direction to the airport. I turned off the GPS and used his directions and traditional road signs to reach to the airport. Thankfully I boarded the flight on time.
