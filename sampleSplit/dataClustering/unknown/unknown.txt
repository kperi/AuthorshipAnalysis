24.1       Introduction 



     Since data clustering is a vast area, it is impossible to cover all the material on the topic in a 

single book. Therefore, this chapter will summarize the key resources in this area. In general, the 

resources on data clustering can be divided into the categories of (i) books, (ii) survey articles, and 

(iii) software. 

     The books on data clustering are mostly generic and are not speci?c to any particular area or 

topic. On the other hand, since surveys are generally more focussed, many more surveys have been 

written, which are speci?c to particular topics, such as high-dimensional data, nonnegative matrix 

factorization, spectral clustering, or text data. Finally, since clustering is used extensively in the 

industry, a signi?cant number of software packages are available for data clustering. 

     The last of the aforementioned categories is an ever changing landscape, since advancements in 

data clustering make older software packages obsolete. Therefore, it is possible that the software 

resources listed in this chapter will eventually become obsolete. Furthermore, it is impossible to 

fully list all the possible resources available in terms of the different kinds of software. Neverthe- 

less, some of the key commercial and noncommercial sources from which data clustering software 



                                                                                                                            607

608                           Data Clustering: Algorithms and Applications 



can be used will be listed. Commercial software packages are generally based on the classical clus- 

tering algorithms, whereas open-source packages are often much more advanced and sometimes 

implement the latest algorithms available in the literature. 

    This chapter is organized as follows. Section 24.2 presents educational resources on data clus- 

tering. This section is itself divided into two subsections. The key books are discussed in section 

24.2.1, whereas the survey papers on data clustering are discussed in section 24.2.2. Finally, the 

software on data clustering will be discussed in section 24.3. Section 24.4 presents the conclusions 

and summary. 



24.2     Educational Resources 



    Educational resources are either generic in the form of books or more focussed on the research 

communities in the form of surveys. Books are generally more useful from a practical perspective, 

whereas survey articles are more useful for an academic perspective. 



24.2.1    Books on Data Clustering 



    Some of the earlier books on data clustering are by Anderberg [3], Duran [9], and Hartigan 

[15]. Much of the developments in data clustering occurred after the writing of these books. Fur- 

thermore, these books were written before the advent of the modern computer age. Therefore, the 

perspective in these books is not necessarily optimized toward the computational design of clus- 

tering algorithms. Many of the classical clustering algorithms were developed after the writing of 

these algorithms, primarily because of the ease in implementation which arose with the use of mod- 

ern computers. 

    Two of the earliest and most well-known books after the advent of the modern computer age 

were written by Jain and Dubes [18] and by Kaufman and Rousseauw [21]. These books discuss 

most of the classical clustering literature, in a way which is easy to understand and comprehend. In 

particular, the book by Kaufman and Rousseauw, written in 2005, was updated to the most recent 

developments in the ?eld at that time. Some of the recent books on data clustering, for example, Xu 

and Wunsch [33], are focused on the classical methods on data clustering. Mirkin [26] addresses the 

topic from the perspective of data recovery. 

    With the advent of database technology and the large amounts of data in the nineties, the issue 

of  scalability  has become  increasingly important. Therefore, a  number of  algorithms have  been 

proposed over the last 15 years, which have been designed in order to improve the scalability of 

the approach. The work in [14] is one of the recent books, which addresses many of the algorithms 

developed by the database community. Nevertheless, the work over the last 15 years is much broader 

and  addresses many different domains of  data,  along with  scalability  issues.  To  the  best  of  our 

knowledge, there is no single book addressing all these issues. This book is therefore an attempt to 

?ll the void in the ?eld. 



24.2.2    Popular Survey Papers on Data Clustering 



    There are numerous surveys on the topic of data clustering. The area of data clustering is so vast, 

that many surveys have been written, which address a speci? c area of data clustering. The surveys 

broadly fall into three categories:

                    Educational and Software Resources for Data Clustering                            609 



    •  General Data  Clustering  Survey: In  these  surveys,  the  problems of  data  clustering  is  ad- 

       dressed in a very general way and is not speci?c to a particular technique or data type. How- 

       ever, the area of clustering is so vast, that most of these surveys tend to be overview articles. 



    •  Technique-Centered Survey: In these surveys, a speci?c technique such as spectral clustering 

       or k-means clustering is addressed in detail. 



    •  Data Type-Centered Survey: In such surveys, a speci?c kind of data type such as time-series 

       data, high-dimensional data, or text data is addressed by the survey. Different data types pro- 

       vide different challenges to  clustering algorithms. Therefore, the  clustering methods for a 

       speci?c data type are often closely related and addressed in a speci?c survey. 



An excellent review article on the topic of data clustering is available in [19]. This article provides 

an overview of the main issues in data clustering. Two other excellent survey articles are available 

in [32, 6]. These provide a good overview of the landscape, though not in much detail. This is to be 

expected, since the area of clustering is too vast to be easily covered by a single publication on the 

topic. 

    Many articles have also been written, which cover speci?c techniques of data clustering. An 

excellent overview article on the k-means algorithm, which also provides a historical perspective, is 

presented in [17]. The k-means method is a classical technique, which is closely related to hierar- 

chical clustering algorithms. This is covered extensively in [28]. Hierarchical clustering algorithms 

are also  used quite frequently for document data for organization of large corpora. A survey of 

such algorithms for document data is presented in [31, 34]. Spectral clustering techniques are an 

important class of methods which have found signi?cant popularity in the clustering literature. Two 

surveys on spectral clustering may be found in [24, 11]. The survey in [24] is considered classical. 

While evolutionary clustering algorithms have not found much popularity in the research literature, 

they have often turned out be quite useful for practitioners. A survey on evolutionary clustering 

algorithms may be found in [16]. 

    Probabilistic  clustering algorithms are  very popular in  the  data  mining literature  because  of 

their natural interpretability. A closely related class of algorithms is the fuzzy clustering method . 

Techniques for fuzzy clustering are covered extensively in [4, 5]. 

    Numerous articles have also been written on clustering in speci?c data types or domains. The 

problem of clustering high dimensional data was ?rst covered in [29] and more recently in [22]. 

Since high-dimensional clustering is a recent topic, and much research on the area has been per- 

formed recently, the latter survey [22] is much more extensive. Document data is a particular case 

of sparse high-dimensional data, for which clustering methods provide a tremendous challenge. For 

example, hierarchical methods for document clustering have been studied in [31, 34], and a more 

general survey on text clustering is provided in [2]. 

    Many data types are contextual in which dependencies exist between the data items. Examples of 

such data sets include (continuous) time-series data, discrete sequential data (which could be either 

temporal or biological), and graph data. Contextual domains provide a special challenge because 

the dependencies between the data items need to be accounted for during the clustering process. 

Numerous surveys have been written to address such contextual domains. An excellent survey on 

time-series data clustering may be found in [23], while the biological data domain is addressed in 

[20, 25]. Graph clustering is a recent area which has been popularized by the advent of social and 

information networks. Graph data clustering is addressed in [12, 30]. The review in [12] is recent 

and particularly extensive.

24.3     Software for Data Clustering 



    A signi?cant amount of software is available for data clustering. Interestingly, most of the so- 

phisticated software on data clustering is open-source software, which is freely available at different 

web sites. On the other hand, most of the commercial software comprises implementations of sim- 

pler and more classical algorithms such as k-means or agglomerative clustering. 



24.3.1    Free and Open-Source Software 



    In this section, we will ?rst address the widely used general purpose clustering software. Later, 

we will provide some additional specialized software that are used for speci?c data clustering ap- 

plications. 



24.3.1.1   General Clustering Software 



    The most well-known general purpose site offering open source software is the WEKA machine 

learning repository [39]. This is a general purpose repository which contains software not just for 

clustering, but also for other data mining related tasks such as data preprocessing, classi?cation, and 

visualization. However, much of the software can also be used for data clustering. 

    Spider is another widely used data mining software which contains the implementations of sev- 

eral popular clustering algorithms [54]. It is an object-oriented environment for machine learning in 

MATLAB. Its recent version also provides WEKA interfaces to the machine learning libraries built 

in Spider. 

    Cluster is another widely used open-source clustering software that contains several clustering 

and visualization algorithms [45]. It is very popular in the bioinformatics community. In addition to 

the standard clustering algorithms, it also provides an excellent graphical environment for analyzing 

complex datasets. The other advantage of this software is that it has interfaces to allows users to use 

the clustering algorithms in other programming environments such as Python, MATLAB, and R. In 

addition to the above mentioned software, programming platforms such as MATLAB and R already 

have their own implementations of some of the commonly used data clustering algorithms. 

    Another comprehensive set of data clustering packages is provided in the ELKI [1] suite of al- 

gorithms that include many classical partitioning algorithms, EM-based probabilistic algorithms, 

density-based algorithms, and subspace clustering algorithms. The KDnuggets web site [42] also 

provides access to a signi?cant number of open-source software sites for clustering and segmenta- 

tion. This can be considered a meta-repository, in that it provides pointers to other relevant sites. 



24.3.1.2   Specialized Clustering Software 



    OpenSubspace is an open-source software that contains the implementations of several subspace 

clustering algorithms [41]. A more detailed description is provided in [27]. It integrates state-of- 

the-art performance measures and visualization techniques for analyzing subspace clusters in the 

WEKA environment. The MOA framework also implements a number of stream clustering algo- 

rithms and provides tools for their evaluation [7]. Related to  Weka, it supports the extension with 

new clustering algorithms, new stream generators, and new evaluation measures. The Weka imple- 

mentation of the framework may be found in [86]. 

    For text data clustering, the cross-bow method is available for download from [43]. This tech- 

nique uses EM-clustering of text data, with the use of hierarchical partitioning of text documents. 

There are also other specialized software such as MALLET [35] which performs clustering along 

with some statistical natural language processing and topic modeling. CLUTO [46] is a software 

package for clustering low- and high-dimensional data sets and for analyzing the characteristics of 


----------------------- Page 637-----------------------

                    Educational and Software Resources for Data Clustering                             611 



the various clusters. One advantage of this software is that it is rather general purpose. It can be used 

for text data, multi-dimensional data, or even transaction data. There are also some other packages 

that perform traditional clustering on text documents [44]. 

    A signi?cant amount of software is also available for contextual data types. For time-series data 

clustering, an open-source software Gait-CAD is publicly available under the GNU public license. 

This is downloadable from sourceforge [49] and is a MATLAB toolbox. For gene expression data 

clustering, one of the most popular tools is Cluster, which has an associated TreeView software for 

better visualization [10]. A more detailed discussion of the available software for analyzing gene 

expression and other forms of biological data can be found in the biological data clustering chapter 

of this book (Chapter 16). 

    Numerous clustering tools are available for graph-partitioning and clustering. The network anal- 

ysis tools (NeAT) [8] provides a number of tools for the analysis of network data, though the focus 

is primarily on biological networks. In addition, many individual graph clustering tools are available 

for download at different sites. One of the most famous family of graph partitioning algorithms is 

METIS [48]. In spite of being one of the earlier methods, it seems to perform competitively with 

most of the graph clustering algorithms, in terms of both effectiveness and ef?ciency. CFinder is a 

free software for ?nding and visualizing overlapping dense groups of nodes in networks, based on 

the Clique Percolation Method (CPM) [53]. Another software for Markov Clustering of networks is 

available at [55]. This approach provides high scalability for the clustering process. For semisuper- 

vised clustering, many implementations of different algorithms that perform constrained clustering 

are available in [57]. 



24.3.2    Commercial Packages 



    Many mathematical tools such as MATLAB [52] come with built-in methods for data clustering. 

However, typically, such methods use classical techniques such as the k-means algorithm. This is 

because these are very general purpose tools, and the clustering capability is not the main purpose 

of such software. However, numerous other commercial tools have been constructed, with a speci?c 

goal of clustering different kinds of data. 

    The KDnuggets site [42] provides a link to some of the more popular forms of software in this 

domain. This site provides pointers to software developed by other vendors such as IBM and SAS 

rather than only its own dedicated software. One of the most well-known ones is the IBM SPSS 

data mining workbench [50]. This includes two step, k-means, and Kohonen clustering algorithms. 

Another well-known package is the SAS Enterprise Modeler [51]. In this case, the clustering tool is 

available with other forms of visual and decision support. SAS contains built-in procedures that can 

perform clustering of even large-scale datasets. 

    Providing full graphics and visualization capabilities is often important for getting an intuitive 

understanding of the clustering process. Clustan [56] offers such capabilities with strong graphics 

support. The NeuroXL Clusterizer  [58] is a commercial tool for clustering with neural networks. 

The advantage of this tool is that it naturally integrates with Microsoft Excel and can, therefore, be 

easily used for spreadsheet data. 



24.3.3    Data Benchmarks for Software and Research 



    Numerous data sets are available for testing clustering software and research. Some of the data 

sets and web sites are general purpose, whereas other web sites are tailored to speci?c kinds of data. 

The most well-known among the general-purpose web sites is the UCI machine learning repository 

[13]. This resource is generally intended for classi?cation, though many of the data sets can also be 

used for clustering. The KDnuggets web site [38] also provides access to many general-purpose data 

sets. This can be considered a meta-repository, in that it provides pointers to other sites containing 

data sets. Similar to this, the other popularly known meta-repositories that give a wide range of 


----------------------- Page 638-----------------------

612                            Data Clustering: Algorithms and Applications 



links to other data repositories are STATOO [71] and David Dowe’s data links [72]. The latter also 

provides several online resources on data mining case studies and competitions. 

    More large-scale datasets are available from the KDD Cup dataset repository [73] and other 

data mining competitions [74]. These datasets are not only large scale but are also directly collected 

from complex real-world problems and hence provide several challenges. Clustering is often used 

in solving such real-world challenges since many of these issues typically fall into the unsupervised 

category. For the statistics community, Statlib dataset archive [75] is a widely used data collection. 

    In addition to the above mentioned real-world datasets, there is also a Fundamental Clustering 

Problem Suite [47] that provides a simple collection of different synthetically generated 2-D and 

3-D datasets. This provides some test datasets with different sizes, shapes, and densities. 

    For speci?c data types, numerous resources are available. For time-series clustering, the UCR 

time-series web site [36] provides access to very long continuous series of data for clustering. An- 

other time-series data library is available at [37]. For the case of network data, the SNAP repository 

[40] hosted by Jure Leskovec at Stanford University provides access to a large number of network 

data sets. 

    For testing the performance of  text document clustering algorithm, there are several publicly 

available text document repositories available. Some of the most popular text document collections 

include Reuters [76], 20NewsGroups [77], TREC [78], and Cora [79]. 

    To evaluate the biological data clustering, there is a plethora of websites that host gene expres- 

sion datasets which can be used to evaluate the clustering algorithms. Gene Expression Omnibus 

(GEO) repository [68] contains a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets along with 

raw source ?les used to generate this data. Gene Expression Model Selector provides a simple repos- 

itory of the most widely studied gene expression datasets [69] and several other cancer-speci?c gene 

expression datasets are available at [70]. Similarly, to test the performance of biological network 

clustering algorithms, there are a plenty of databases that contain protein-protein interactions. The 

most popular ones are DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins) [66], BioGRID [67], STRING (Search 

Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) [65] and MIPS (Mammalian Protein-Protein 

Interaction Database)  [64].  The last  resource contains links to  several other  interaction network 

databases. 

    To evaluate the sequence data clustering algorithms, several biological sequence database repos- 

itories are available at [63]. The most widely used repositories are GenBank [61] and EMBL [62] for 

nucleic acid sequences and Protein Information Resources (PIR) [60] and UniProt [59] for protein 

sequences. 

    In the context of image applications, researchers in machine learning and computer vision com- 

munities have used clustering for solving automatic grouping of images and image segmentation 

problems. Clustering can help in ef?cient organization and retrieval of image databases. ImageCLEF 

[82] and ImageNet [83] are two widely used image data repositories which are used to demonstrate 

the performance of image data retrieval tasks. Data clustering can also be used in the context of im- 

age segmentation. Vision and Autonomous Systems Center’s Image Database [80] from Carnegie 

Mellon University and the Berkeley Segmentation dataset [81] can be used to test the performance 

of clustering for image segementation problems. An extensive list of websites that provide image 

databases is given in [84] and [85]. 



24.4     Summary 



    This chapter presents a summary of the key resources for data clustering in terms of books, 

surveys, and  commercial and  noncommercial software  packages. While  many of  the  books and

surveys address different aspects of data clustering in terms of either techniques or data types, there 

seems to be a gap in creating a single integrated book, which covers the modern literature on this 

topic. This book is intended to ?ll that gap.
