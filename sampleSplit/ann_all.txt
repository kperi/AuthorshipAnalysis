Ditto Andrea--my only interaction with CUMERC was an orientation for the interns when I arrived and it's been hard to go back since our work hours are the same as the center's. It seems like a great place though and I've been surprised at the number of people I've met here who are familiar/involved with it. Great article and pics, Melissa.
Ben GET YOUR BUTT BACK ON SKYPE! Jordan is beautiful and being here has been interesting. The side streets in Amman where I live look/feel exactly like the ones in Taiwan...the smell of jasmine is everywhere . I'm starting to feel pretty settled in/attached. How's Singapore?
Nope still at work, won't be home til tonight.
Yes! road trip to the "path of annularity"? Can we get one of those storm chaser vans and drive around the country for the rest of our lives observing astronomical events?
Looking for a sublet in NYC for July and/or August. If you know of anything, please me know!
