Hmm, good writer for sure, but I disagree with the general premise that the school should be co-ed. My attraction to it was similar to her's. To get away from the distractions and lose myself in a difficult and intense contemplative process. If the school is co-ed it lacks the monastic feel essential for this sort of focus. We can talk more about it later, but thanks for the article. Got me all nostalgic.
I think that was the right decision in this case. The debate got so vitriolic in the 90's that it almost closed down the school because donors were pulling funding. If the Telluride foundation really felt strongly about giving girls the chance a such an education I think starting another different school that is only female would be the best option. It preserves the integrity of the education and keeps trustee fighting at a minimum.
I don't think "separate but equal" really applies simply because the type of education this girl is looking for is impossible to produce in a co-ed environment. Unlike racial segregation where inclusion did not diminish the services and in fact enhanced the general wellbeing of all associated, the quality of the school is partially based on that exclusionary principle.
Thank You for the birthday wishes! Feeling very fortunate to call such a quality group of people my friends.
