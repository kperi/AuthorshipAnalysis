Ok. Susie just emailed me. Her mom does not have cancer in the brain. She is going to try to male it to class after all.
"If they keep her mom over night, that would be good for Susie."
I sent her a message asking if she thinks they will keep her mom. waiting on a reply. I will keep you posted
They are keeping her mom.
