I would be there at least by 4:00 am at the latest. They are open all night so their lines start forming early in the store. Hard to really say when you should be there. How bad do you want the item?
"Yes, lines form inside then stores. They have signs up that say, line forms here. Last year they did not say which line was for what item. So you should ask before standing in a line."
Din't think so.
