Not a problem. I just cannot always handle things as quickly as others may want them handled or i am busy with stuff that cannot be interrupted. No harm. I know mom gets upset with Michael and thinks i protect him. I just pick my Smith. Sometimes it is perception. I have to make those calls as they arise. I am not mad at you. Still love you. Stop tearing up. Been really busy thats all.
I need to eat more than apples. But want to lose wait. No harm at all. Just trying to keep.everyone happy is making me sick. Maybe that will change  soon. Talk soon.
Janet passed away tonight.
Will do.
