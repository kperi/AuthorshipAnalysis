"Michael is not doing well at all. The death was sudden and unexpected from what I understand. His mom was only 50 and apparently had a bought of pneumonia, went to the doctor, he ran test, and sent her home. I guess she died in her husbands arms at work. He cannot go home for two reasons, no passport / could not return and no money. I am so sorry that he cannot be there."
Oh my. Not a very good week thus far. Hope she continues to improve. Give mom a big from me.
She is doing good. Strange situation that we have no answer for. She sees the Dr today.
Love you too. I will keep you posted.
