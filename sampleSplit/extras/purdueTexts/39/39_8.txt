"The kids want to spend the night and i said yes, but told them it was up to you."
"My last message was a reply to your message today, so it went to your phone. I guess I will go meet Kristin."
I don't mind as long as you clean it all up when you are done.
Thanks for leaving me dishes and food in the garbage disposal. Have A GREAT night.
