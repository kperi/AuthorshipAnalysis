"We tried 2 call, but we got vm. My cell does not have enough battery to call. We had to get our room and we are grabbing a quick bite to eat."
On our way home. 230 more miles. Should be home after 4:30 pm. May have to stop for gas and potty breaks. So maybe add a 1/2 hours or so on to eta.
Sore as hell. Dr apt tomorrow. All out of tetanus at dr corse due to power outage last week.
More so if adam cleaned it enough. It is too late to stitch now to the best of my knowledge.
