Tom is in ICU 617 coughed up blood again and coded.
No worries. At hospital. Waiting for visiting hours to start
He is in a drug induced coma and drug induced paralysis. Holding his own right now. I have to leave soon to go to work. He is in 617 icu if you want to come up.
"Not in a good place, but optimistic."
