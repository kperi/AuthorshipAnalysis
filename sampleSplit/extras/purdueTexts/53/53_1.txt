How is mom doing today? Tom and you doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances?
I will make time. Mexican dinner maybe?
Sorry to hear about mom. What put her back in the hospital and at chicago to boot?
Sat nite will work for me. Taking the kids to go see the lorax that afternoon. I will be ready for adult drinks by evening. Lol.
