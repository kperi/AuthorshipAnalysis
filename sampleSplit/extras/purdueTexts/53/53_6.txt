How is mom doing this morning? Do you need anything? Are you eating?
"If you need me, you know i am here for you. Just call."
What is the status of mom? Please tell me she is stable and resting comfortable.
I wish i could help in some way. Why are my prayers not being answered? Your mom deserves them.
