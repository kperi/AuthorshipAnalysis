Just let me know what works for you. I have classes on tuesday and wednesday. Then on spring break.
How is your mom doing this morning? I am praying for her.
I can come to the hospital. I just don't want to interfere with moms comfort and such.
"That will be fine. That is why i have not come up there. I know your mom does not care for all that attention when she is not feeling well. She needs her rest, not frustration and agitated by visitors."
