I pray she has a restful night so you can get one too. Call le if you need. I will keep my cell phone next to my bed. Love to you both.
Prayers were for your mom to make it through the night and you to get some rest. I hope they were answered. How is mom?
Did you make it home safely?
Drive safely.
