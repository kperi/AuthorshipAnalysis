Amanda is leaving for the night. Not much more they can do. Amanda says stay home.
"Lucinda, according to Amanda - Tom is stable. They are going to put a camera down his throat to see what might have happened. No new blood, he is resting comfortably now. Unsure what time they are going to start the procedure. Her number is 773-555-1212 if you want to text her or call her. Love you."
"Tom suffered a micro tear in his stomach by the esophogius. As long as he does not do anything to cause it to bleed again, they are planning on letting it heal itself. He is also off the ventilater. Sorry cannot spell."
Me neither.
