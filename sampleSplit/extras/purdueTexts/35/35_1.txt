Bad storms coming in. Get timmy ready for pops. It's here.
Timmy called. They are on their way home. Staying in Kentucky. Jenny says they will be at Friday on Sunday at 6pm. Said to tell you and daddy Michael that he loves you both and see you day after tomorrow.
I have to run to work for a little while. I have to reboot a server.
Where is timmy's Batman Wii game?
