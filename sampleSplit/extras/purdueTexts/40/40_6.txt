"Samantha said to text you or her when i could, what's up?"
"I have free tickets to take the kids to school's learning center to see a laser light show. It starts at 6:45 pm. I want to be there no later than 6:15 so we can ensure we have seats together as the room is not that big. If you want to drop them off early, i am ok with that. Just let me know what time. You can have a night to do whatever you want. I just need clothes for them on Sunday so i can also get their pictures done."
By four maybe. That way i can feed them first.
Sure. Sounds good. I rhink the kids will like this show. Only 45 minutes long so we won't be out late.
