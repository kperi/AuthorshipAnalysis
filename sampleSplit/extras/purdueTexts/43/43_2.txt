I will send her up something tomorrow. Maybe it will lift her spirits and give her a smile. Hope it helps in some small way.
Ok. I will be around. When you are up to it.
Very nice. Hope it goes well.
My cough has made my chest hurt again. Not a good feeling. Make sure you rest and take care of yourself. We need you healthy and so does your mom. Worried about you.
