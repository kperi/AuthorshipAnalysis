"Well, you may not have a job now."
I sent you an email you need to read.
"You may not have a job. When you get in, read your email and then set up appointment to speak with me."
"You can come on campus to remove anything that is yours from the office and sign your time card any time after 9:30 am today. If you have in your possession anything that belongs to the university, you are to bring it with you at that time."
