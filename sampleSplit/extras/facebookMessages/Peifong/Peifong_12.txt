Dear Parents, By now, you probably already know that kids are going to have a BBQ party at my house this coming Saturday. (On a second thought, most of you probably don't know yet:) Not to be outdone by kids, you are also invited to join and have fun. We'll have enough BBQ stuff and drink for everyone but you are welcome to bring a dish for the variety, or specialty. Please let me know as soon as possible if you are coming and how many of you. But you are also welcome to just show up without advanced notice. Hey, it is summer time! Look foward to seeing you, Chuni and Chia.
