i am going to china trip with you. i will let you do one-week alone trip in CA, with NO driving.
or your can go hiking in East blue mountain.
by yourself.
you still need to earn my trust on your driving.
but your driving hours is 1% of mine.
well, you cannot say you are a better driver than me, because you never drive 4 hours none-stop, you never drive in jammed traffic for 6 hours...
you cannot say you are better.

you go ahead to book it.
