i think it's true - that like finding elements - we need to find the patterns.
all sciences are the same - need to find the patterns.
are you coming back tomorrow night?
after dinner.
anyway, watch the link: http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1489.
be a great scientist.
and come home if you can after dinner, so you can get license on Sat morning.
immerse yourself in learning.
clean up the house. fold the sleeping bag.

did you fold the sleeping bag.
and clean up the place like no guests before.
it's quite annoying if the living place is messy.

respect the rule of the lease.
cook some eggs.
and the chicken sauage is going to expire in mid-july.
so cook them.
otherwise, bring them home.

why not now?
Ask the doorman if you need to be there.
ask the doorman if they can come earlier or borrow the tools from door man now.
you probably need to be there - which is very inconvenient.
so ask the doorman for tools.
when? do you need to be there?
you tell him the contact is inside, right?
leave a note on the sink!!!!
please leave a clear note on sink.
otherwise, plumber usually will flush it.
go to bed early.
of course you shoudl put it in.
so at least one eye can still see.
use other sink.
