some companies may check, i don't really think so, but no need to leave the doubt for things not left by you.
How are you, DoDo?

it's your study period, you should be able to do some interview.
EDIT the cover letter by removing the name, company.

people who are doing interview in 12/22 till new year could be bitter, no life.
or workholic.
of course, you should say Thank you!!
and say you are looking forward to it!
INCLUDE JAN.
Make sure you include CoVER letter.
other people will read.
then decided who might interested to talking to you.

dodo.
what are you doing?
where are you?
k.
make sure you save some energy to drive home.
and let me know if you are coming home for dinner, then i can cook.
but don't stay too late - you need energy, and focus to drive an hour.
k.
did you do the one with deadline 1/6 - AppNexus?
also PAY ATTENTION in your chinese class - very very focus!
ok. that's good. the temperture will drop from 60 to 11 by 5PM.
so still need a jacket!!
can you send me your resume?
well, there is something due 1/10, but I am not sure if you should apply.
1.8 - are Keller.
there are also two due on 1/17, but i am also not sure if you should apply, the job desciptions are not too impressive.
so focus on Kellers.
ok.
even there is no essay, you should still send in your cover letter.
the worst is, they will not read it.
but they didn't say you cannot submit extra material.
so for Keller, still send in your cover letter!
1/10 is PPPL, 1/17 is Charles River (financial company) and City of Chicago.
City of Chicago maybe more interested than the financial one.
Research thing - you should apply once you finish your finals. it's also First come first serve until it's filled.
ok.
