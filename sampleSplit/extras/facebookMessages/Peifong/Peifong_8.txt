this Sat let's see if we can get refund from Silberber.
but then who?
i'd rather spend money to protect your eyes.
you only have one pair.
for the entire life span.
silberberg hasn't called back and i called them twice already.
what is 300mb/month?
k.
AT&T's iphone is better.
can use it at Taiwan.
but verizon's cannot.
is there a AT&T wireless at near-by location near your apartment?
holmdel doesn't have good att wireless office to check.
k.
so AT&T give us more data.
Ann is 300 mb.
we have 700 min currently.
maybe - when Ann talked to Shy.
just don't go over.
k.
if the price is the same, ATT's iPhone is better.
no, they have less customers.
so their network is less crowded.
but if we are going abck to Taiwan, AT&T.
's iPhone still work.
but not Verizons.
by the way, i probably will not get iPhone for you and Ann.
you two will get the most inexpensive smart phone.
if we do go this expensive monthly plan.
i will check with friends too.
did you write to Rahul.
why not.
what do you mean by Why.
other smart phone also work.
and i don't want you to use smart phone for music.
also, iphone just easier to get stolen, rob..etc.
don't argue with me.
be grateful.
hey, i am not sure i want to spend that much money every month.
can you please stop.
i am very not happy and worry about your eyes.
go to bed early please.
right now, my highest priority on you, is to get your eyes (lens thing) set.
so i really need you to go to bed early.
and take good care of your eyes.
write to rahul.
looks good.
tell him Ken also goes to Holmdel High.
tell him he is also in the Math league and got perfect score in the shore.
praise your friend.
so Rahul knows you are also recommending someone good to him.
he will appreicate that.
Good night.
please go to bed early.
clean up the house. etc. no need for air condition these days, right.
