Daway, how about we go to Istanbul on 3/15 evening, and come back on 3/21 - while you and Ann have the same spring break.
or we can leave on 3/19, and come back on 3/23.
maybe 3/19-3/23 better - i expect you will have paper to due.
there are cheap airline tkt to istanbul - $399 per person, round trip,
but leave from DC.
