How are you, my dear?
Good Luck!!
be resourceful.
and focus!!!!
i am giving you all my luck!
ttyl.
Daway, how are you?
Daway.
be a good student, ok.
dont drink and don't do drug - it hurts your body, and kill your brain cell.
GN.
hi DoDo, how are you.
how aer you?
k.
because you too nervous?
it's ok.
the important thing is you learn.
and know what went wrong.
and look forward to get it right next time.
don't get frustrated!!!
resilient!
also you can go talk to teacher.
ask for another chance and tell the teacher why you did so bad - if you can figure out why.
share your finding with your teacher.
they would appreciate that.
ok.
you need to be resilient. don't get frustrated or discouraged!
because you were confused with some concept?
if you just missed one concept or mess up something with another - explain to the teacher, no matter what , this shows the teacher that your willingness and you care about the class!!! it's priceless and valuable that student can face their failure and discuss it with the teachers.
i am going to bed.
GN.
be resiliant!
dont get discouraged!
love.
GN.
how are you, Dodo?
good luck on the midterm.
C+ is not bad.
you will get better.
but make sure you know why you messed up - you need to learn it so solid - so it's like musule memory!
how are you?
why?
the weather is going to be bad.
i want to pick you up as early as possible.
Daway,
but you have been to NYC so many times.
and COlumbia.
how about you go to NYC, then take the NJ transit to Holmdel.
how many days is your break.
sigh.
talk to Ann - make sure you are all good.
how long you can stay at home?
make sure you are organized.
ALSO, NO WEED or STUPID STUFFS!!!!!!! YOU PROMISED ME!!!!
Hey DoDo.
Make sure you packed computer, contact lens etc. DONT DRINK!! GO TO BED!!!!
use hte best of next hour to study while you have electricity.
Did you vote?
that should be enough.
you can only vote for presidnet.
just go vote.
so you have time to adjust to whatever situation come up.
but you definitely can vote, since your home is in the disaster area of Sandy, not heat, no power.
did they let you vote statewide electrions?
they told me you can only vote President.
so did you vote the local as well?
or just President.
k.
tomorrow and thursday will be very cold, dress warm!
and stay dry.
DoDo.
just to let you know I am at Anchi's house.
since we still have no power.
Elizbeth Warren won!!
Obama WON.
wow, it's quite amazing.
so he lost popular vote, but won, good game played.
DoDo.
how are you?
yep, stay warm?
home still have no power.
k.
not sure when the power will be back.
with the new winter storm, we got more outage.
and our house seems to have the lowest priority.
Dod, i am going to bed now, after raking leaves - i am sleepy now.
do you need more help on chinese?
From my iPhone. Let me know if u got it.
Daway did you receive the email on how to setup router?
Dod.
