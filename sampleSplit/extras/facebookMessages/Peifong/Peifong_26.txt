Daway,
can you ever grow up and have once , jut once, realize, letting me travle with you in China is my dream come true.
and i don't need to worry about you either.
and my life long dream to travel china.
yes,
why can't you grow up and be nice to your mom.
why you have to be so childish, thinking travel with me is ruining your indpendance.
well, when you are traveling with your friends - it's big city, right.
why you put the equal sign of me to the ruin.
Daway. you really need to grow up be mature.
what's wrong with that.
why you have to limite your purpose only to youself.
I AM COMING.
it's your trip.
I AM COMING.
I AM COMING.
I AM COMING.
why can't you go to TX or some toher places to visit your friends.
instead of roadtrip.
what roadtrip, how long, who with etc.
NO.
by car?
NO.
you can do that when you are out of college.
Daway, you really need to be more considerate.
You are taking adventage of your mother.
I AM COMING with you.
NO.
No roadtrip.
i worry accidient.
yes, you can drive, and i let you dirve, but not for 3 weeks alone.
but not now.
i will let you travel alone for one week in CA by transportation - you can go to the parks, APPLE, GOOGLE's new headquarter etc - you will sleep at friends house to cut the cost, except bus fee and meals,
not driving.
then CA, you can go camping.
you can go to all the national parks in CA.
you can go to all the place by bus, napa valley to rent a bike.
daway, did you really drive on highway many times?
i am not going to let you do that when you haven't even had a lot of highway, busy traffice expereince.
when you are back home, i will let you drive on NJ turnpike.
and let's see about that.
what you have is garden state park way, not much traffic.
anyway, Daway, i am your family.
