as i could still picture some of your life.
no.
what did you say?
my cell phone is low on battery.
use emails or IM.
why.
who needs it.
it's at sublet.com.
i can teach them how to search.
i can forward the email to you.
what she needs to do is to select the area, rent, etc.
i think i am still a member.
there are information for public (non-member).
and information for member only.
the places i looked probably too old for her now.
they have a lot of new listings.
every week.
then she can call them, or email them.
there are still a lot available.
also, if she and her sister are looking.
there are places only for females.
and much cheaper.
but since you are not females.
so you are not qualify.
i can forward the info to you.
do you want me to?
k.
tell me about your dinner plan.
i love you. be nice to your mother.
Wed might be storms.
i just sent you the attachemnt - alternative housing at NYC.
read my email.
Do-Do.

did you get this link.
Do-Do?
every listing has a link "rental details".
she can click the rental details - it will list if it has wi-fi, doorman, laundry...etc etc.
the link "map" will show details.
but i search the area near Columbia-Morningisde already.
she can change to mid-town east, or upper-east side etc.
but again, tell her to go to the places for females only on that alternative housing.
but since this is so late.
the houseing there most likely is gone.
then she can try sublet.com - that's the link i just paste here.
actually i did try the alternative houseing -all places are gone. the only places i havent' tried are the places for females.
females only.
so she should not try places take boys - because they already out.
cook the chicken sausage - it has expireation date on july 13.
eat the fruits from this Sunday -in the cans.
before it goes bad.
can i give away your SAT Subject test books on Bio and Chemistry.
not AP, but SAT.
