you will arrive at US on 9/7 because when you travel this direction, you gain one day.
where are you right now?
k.
Daway, you need to get exit Visa from PSB at GuangZhou in order to get out of China. You need to show them a flight ticket - so they can expedite it. otherwise, it's one week. If the place take Visa or AE, use those cards, and save your cash. US consulate take AE _ they cannot take my visa since you will have to sign my name there.
Apply the "Emergency passport" at Guangzhou. We will do the normal when you are back to US. The emergency passport only take 1-2 hour, then go to China PSB to apply the exit visa. Once you got the visa, get the ticket to Taiwan for the very next flight. But show them your original flight ticket to ask them to expedite it. Love.
DoDo.
cancel the US open tkt, please.
