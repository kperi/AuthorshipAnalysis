King Ban of Benwick, noble son of Erich Rode forth from Trebes, his handsome head held high. His steed was roan, his armor made of silver His gauntlet glistened in the morning light. Encrusted were his spurs with sparkling diamonds And seed pearls did adorn his gilded greaves Whilst Coreiseuse he brandished with great gusto So bright it shone among the linden leaves.
