"Applicants should come to get the visas on time. Visas not taken away after 90 days from the day it should be taken away will be deemed abandoned.".
so we're probably fine.

but will you still be able to go on thursday.
ok.
and do you want to meet up or go in together?R.
what's the train station nearest to your house?
oh so we're not on the same line.
like princeton junction --> penn station doesn't sotp at hazlet.
mm not sure let me check.
yup.
here's the map if you want to see the closest one: http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/Rail_System_Map.pdf.
i'm princeton junction.
ok so on thursday.
if you wanted.
i could take the 10:27 from princeton junction to rahway, which arrives at 11:04.
and you could take the 10:18 hazlet to rahway, which arrives at 10:51.
and then switch to my line to continue on to penn station.
so you'd have a 13 minutes to transfer.
lollllll.
omg calm down.
that took a lot of planning.
i have like 6 tabs up.
haha YAY.
HAHA that would be literally so dumb.
ok but fine yeah sounds good.
