i'll look into the travel agent thing.
"Hey, the flight price dropped for the non-stop. The difference between the non-stop and the Canadian one-stop is now $278, instead of about $500. I am tempted to buy you guys the non-stops. Hope that works for Daway. It is $1310." from my mom.
which do you prefer?
the cheaper one has a 5 hour lay over in Canada and gets us there at 4 P.M. the nonstop gets us there a little earlier.
i don't care, my mom wants nonstop.
why.
but we'll be sleeping for most of it...
omg it looks like it's stuck up my nose.
hahahaha ew.
ok so you don't care?

wait how do you have time to go to this and not to go to disiac?
lololol from my mom: "Less risk when there are fewer take-offs and landings. (Just like anesthesia, the critical times of the event are induction and emergence. Many parallels between the airline industry and anesthesia. Interesting topic.) Also, I just checked with Air Canada, and you guys would have to clear customs in Canada before going on to Beijing.".
hmm yeah they both have their merits.
