because it expired.
i literally hate everyone in the entire world.
this was probably the biggest mistake of my entire life.
so far.
just a little self-reflection for you.

you're obviously bored since you're checking facebook.
IT IS A BIG DEAL.
no that would be 12:23.
i want to take a year off and be a nanny.
and beekeep.

that way i can make money.
and then maybe travel.
and do more beekeeping.
