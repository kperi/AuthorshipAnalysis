besides it's supposed to storm tonight.
yes, if i sent you a message at 4:08.
NO I FORBID YOU.
will you send me port of morrow.
pretty pleeaaaase.
hey, you know what would be a good present for the people we're couchsurfing with? a CD of music.
send me 9-10 songs you want to include.
what no that's weird.
we should just burn the CDs beforehand. it's not likely that our tastes in music will coincide that much anyway. and besides, we're trying to share new music with them, not give them music that they already know they like.

wait wait you think 5.5 is unattractive?
you gave tori rinker a 5.6.
and reina a 5.7...
but that would imply that princeton girls are more attractive, if you're giving those girls low scores.
she has a pretty face.
i'm fixing reina's rating for you.
m.
wife material.
rather than bang material.
anticipated you^.
date material.
ugh are you saying i'm not bang material i'm so offended.
oh...
um nevermind.
right i forgot.
lollll.
but that would mean you think reina and tori aren't girl next door types.
by that logic.
just saying it doesn't really follow.
lol.
ha isn't the older stuff always supposed to be better?
"YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU LIKE THE OLD STUFF BETTER".
i forget where that's from.
no.
gosh get over yourself.
