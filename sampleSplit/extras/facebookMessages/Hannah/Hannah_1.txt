daway, do you know if we have any reading assignments for our freshman sem this week? it doesn't look like there's anything on the syllabus but i couldn't remember if she said anything at the end of class.
ohhh i bet you're right - i didn't realize those were readings from the books we got. let me know if she says something different!
oh or i guess the stuff after BB will be posted on blackboard.
nooooo i haven't.
do you want to watch it together?
uhh well i was going to go to bed kind of early tonight. did you want to actually watch or just talk about it?
oh ok cool. ehm before midnight? can we watch tomorrow? or do you have sympoh?
also what res college are you in?
i'm basically completely free after 2:30 tomorrow.
ok! i just checked and the movie is 126 minutes. is that going to be too long?
ok sounds good. where do you want to watch?
yes actually.
ok sounds good.
it's kind of nice to have a movie for part of our homework haha.
see you then!
oh also numbers in case i can't find it? i'm (609)577-0749.
oh yeah forgot about that. haha k see you tomorrow!
wtf did i just watch.
-______-
it was pretty weird although i was disappointed i didn't get to see the part where the man bites off the woman's fingers.
ehehehue noooo.
hahahahahaha.
you're right, i did.
do you know what movie you're doing for the sequence analysis?
oh obvi -_- yeah it's definitely the most artistic/ cinematically interesting... also it's so weird you can interpret it however you want GREETINGS FROM PENNINGTON, NJ 12 hours ago i was in portland, though, soooooo yeah don't think you're special.
-_____________- portland was fun! warmer than here actually. it's freezing. i'm maaaad >:( lawlz you would... wait you're exactly like my mom. i'm all for sleeping. it's vacation after all!!
i didn't laugh! i gave you the -______- face. the "lawlz" was in reference to your wanting to get up at 7, not to your watching the bresson films.
also remember that the video reserves only work on the princeton wireless network, so you'll have to find lancelot du lac somewhere else online if you want to write about it.
wut did you rent it or something.
..................
