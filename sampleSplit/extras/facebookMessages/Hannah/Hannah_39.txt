cry me a river.
"We are leaving the B .C . coast—rain, cloud, mist—an air overladen with weeping . Behind us lies a salty sea, within which swim our drowning specks of memory—our small waterlogged eulogies . We are going down to the middle of the Earth with pick-axe eyes, tunneling by train to the interior, carried along by the momentum of the expulsion into the waiting wilderness.".
if you can write something like that out of your pain.
i'll consider it justified.
ugh you can tell i was too lazy to type out that one myself :/.
sorry for the messed-up punctuation.
choose one phrase out of that that stands out to you the most.
don't think about it too much.
just choose.
hmm really.
oh interesting.
i'd choose pick-axe eyes.
yeah now that i think about it i'm not really sure how to make sense of it.
but it was the one that stuck with me.
one of the ap lit tests...
but originally from obasan.
by joy kogawa.
crap i think it was on an SAT test.
the native american thing.
not the ap lit test.
dammit.
this is going to be impossible to find.

United Airlines, UA89, arrival 6/21 at 13:45.
yup.
isn't it so nice and peaceful.
idk :/ i probably won't be able to handle 6 classes but i'd really like to learn another language.
princeton teaches languages a lot better than my high school did. so even though i got a 5 on the AP, the class i took (GER 209, literature after 1700) was really really hard and it didn't improve my fluency or grasp of grammatical structures because it was based on discussions of literature. ideally, i would have taken GER 107-108 to brush up on my language skills, but that would have required forfeiting my AP credit (and i would have felt like it was a waste since I already placed out).
i'm basically in an in-between stage of fluency where 107/108 would be a waste but anything higher would take a disproportionate amount of time and effort.
i don't think you undertand how difficult 209 was.
it was like 2 hours of reading every night.
and a lot of that was spent just looking up words i didn't know in the dictionary.
no but chinese is actually improving my fluency and that class really wasn't.
and like there were people in the class who had lived abroad in germany and i think one girl was even a native speaker.
sooooo yeah.
-_-
ughhhhhh are you friends with michael chang did you see his pictures from bermuda.

wow we really are too alike.
i've forgotten calculus :'(.
it's actually really satisfying to cross-reference multiple resources and ultimately understand a concept.
i should write a textbook.
you probably got a 5 on the ap.
what does it mean then.
hm.
:| :| :| :|.
quantum.
-_-
i don't understand did you lose all your math skills after 8th grade or something.
huh.
i did a fair amount. 3 chinese lessons, a few chapters of middlemarch, and now i'm trying to figure out this blackbody stuff.
soooooo i think i'm good.
how'd you fare.
that's not bad.
there's still time.
hmm idk probably the 5th or 6th.
why?
what'd she say?
ugh i don't care about your opinion.
aww.
yeah i agree 2 is my least favorite.
i'd actually probably give the same ranking -_-
although that may be just confirmation bias.
or w/e you call it.
the power of suggestion.
idk.
