yeah... kinda dumb.
jk it's awesome obviously.
but so...
idk.
i'm tired -_-
going to bed soon.
**signing off, gooood night.
buuhhhhhh.
oh and about the kate thing i just meant that that's definitely not the way you act around a normal friend... idk why it seemed more obvious afterwards. sometimes these things are just clearer in retrospect, you know?
and by "a thing", i mean........... ;).
did you see this on reddit? pretty well done http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1e6ca2/the_1974_gatsby_recut_in_the_style_of_the_2013/.
omg thx.
and yeah let's!!
we need to apply for our visas ASAP. minimum one month before we leave. do you think it's ok to go on 5/21 since we were planning on going into the city that day anyway or should we go before? start filling this out: http://newyork.china-consulate.org/chn/lszj/P020110622119203610776.pdf if you don't have an answer for something, write "N/A" instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.org/eng/lsyw/lszjx/sbqz/df/t965264.htm.
ok and we'll have to return on the 25th/26th to pick up our visas (assuming all goes well).
download & save the pdf first, then fill it out on your computer, otherwise it won't save.
idk.
last day maybe.
last day for move out is the 25th.
(Y).

no i'm good i don't want to risk temptation.
i doubt it...
or like i'm sure you could digest it but it would be disgusting.
ewwww.
do not want.
loll i just saw helen posted that.
and no it's too revealing, i would feel uncomfortable.
it is interesting.
if the bodice were connected to the top of the skirt in the front, i might wear it.
oh really i don't have a problem with the back.
but the front just looks like a bra because of the cut-outs.
lol.
why because they'll want to wear scandalous dresses?
mmm.
??????????????
ha.
what do you think of girls who wear those dresses now?
as a young male, not as a father.
why are some stupid?

?????
could have been uglier.
