listen to the scherzo.
ooh i still have to check it out.
tell me when you're done with those.
you really have to listen to the scherzo multiple times to appreciate it.
the etude is an easy listen.
sometimes i like to read along with the music.
here's the scherzo.
i have two more chopin pieces i think you'll really like.
didn't you play for a few years?
ok, you definitely know this piece: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvm2ZsRv3C8.
mmm -_-
listen to the fantasie.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IbCEF1XF9Q.
:).
ok one more chopin etude.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOe670xcKhk.
this is probably one of my favorite pieces to play.
i feel like i'm force-feeding you.
noooooooo.
only a few.
mmmmmmmmmmmaybe.
i haven't really sat down and practiced in almost a year now.
i'm probably terrible.
mm -_-
did you listen?
hahaha usually that's not what you're thinking about.
i bet you've heard this before: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh36PaE-Pf0.
no.
listen to the arabesque.
you think it's fine.
.
oh.
?????
of course you do.
i have great taste.
well you said you weren't crazy about the scherzo.
but like i said... we listen to the good stuff. the stuff that's survived all these years.
yeah...
since classical music follows a certain set of rules, you usually don't get that sort of thing.
with atonal music and more avant garde stuff, there are definitely pieces you will not like right away.
do you want some avant garde stuff?
actually wait.
you know who i bet you'll REALLY like.
he's more minimalist than avant garde.
