haha ok.
and not too much.
:D.
yeah i think i've heard of that before!
that's awesome.
YES wait i've definitely read about this.
where is that from?
did you know the portuguese man-of-war is really just a collection of zillions of little polyp creatures.
it's not even one animal.
?
wowww holy crap that's WEIRD.
it's almost like a mushroom or something.
but how would you install the hiv with the quorum sensing ability?
sure.
yeah but doesn't quorum sensing refer to the ability of the cell to gauge its own population levels?
could you do that?
wait, so the proteins would have the quorum sensing ability?
orly.
haha.
aww :(.
not aids, just hiv!
think positive.
just not hiv-positive.
well i laid it out for ya just in case.
ugh stop.
I GET TO BE THE CONDESCENDING ONE.
i was also going to say "i'm killin it" but then wasn't sure how to follow it up with a non-sensitive reference to aids.
lawl.
only 20 min till sunrise.
sunrise is coming soon.
"summer's coming soon.
pining for the moon".
why did you decide to admit you liked me? you could have played it off like "oh yeah i agree we should never date".
i would have let you get away with it.
kekeh.
hahaha what why?
yeah...
huh i don't really get that logic but ok.
hao, wo liao jie.
kept talking about other stuff when?
oh.
yeah.
like if you didn't want to talk about it.
i wanted to give you something else to talk about.
oh.
i'm sorry :(.
it wasn't intended that way.
yes, but i should have known it wouldn't work on you.
was this better?
i'd have said "hey, i like you a lot too, but i don't want to ruin our friendship.".
yeah, as a friend.
(well now you're getting both ends of it so it doesn't really matter does it? ha).
ugh i was trying to think of a way to work it into conversation.
haha nooooooo.
yes but you had the buffer of the internet.
SUNRISE!!!
ok sorry should i take it back?!?!
but we are friends.............
ARE YOU GOING TO RETRACT OUR FRIENDSHIP AFTER THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

do you think that is a bad reason?
hummm ok.

i like you as a friend but am not interested in you romantically.

man you're weird, who would voluntarily be rejected a second time?
and suggest it, no less.
HAHA.

the yes was not an acceptance, btw... in case you were confused.
fine, fine, whatever.
