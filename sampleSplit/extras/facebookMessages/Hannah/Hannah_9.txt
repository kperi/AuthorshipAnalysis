wo mama shuo: Hi Hannah, I am currently checking out flights. Would you and Daway be able to travel on Tuesday Sept 3rd and arrive on Wed Sept 4? That would be good because I am able to get Sept 4 off as a vacation day and can pick you up at the airport. Also, does Daway care if you fly into Philly? I could drive you both back to our house, and his family would then only need to drive from Holmdel to Pennington. love, Mom.
what day were you planning on going to Taiwan?
so you'd still have 2 days...
