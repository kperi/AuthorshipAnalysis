chapter 77.
i dunnooooo.
i thought of you.
isn't she good at that? at voicing those thoughts you have but never really adequately put into words?
ya.
-_-
hence the word "adequately".
hans zimmer AMA going on right now.
"I wish more people would realize that to follow their dreams is the only way to live a life worth living.".
you disagree?
doing what you love? experiencing a life which has a seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it?
at least you would've tried.
you wouldn't feel like a sell-out.
ok i have to go find out what happens in middlemarch.
el oh el.
finis.
ni ne?
ugh i never would have consumed it like that if you hadn't been reading it too.
i felt rushed.
the flight leaves at 11:50 AM.
we arrive at 7:03 AM in philly.
noooooooooooooo we leave from newark omg i'll just forward you the flight info.
i think we actually get back on the 8th if i'm reading this correctly.
i was about to go to bed.
i fell aslepep at 7 and just woke up because it was too hot but i'm really tired.
I'M TIRED.
yeah.........
yes.
if i wake up later and am not tired i'll let you know.
ugh now what :/.
oh my god there's a millipede on my floor.
oh no i think i killed the millipede :( i put a jar over it so i could take it out this morning and now it's all curled up and not moving.
ha.
:(.
IF YOU COME TOMORROW WE ARE MAKING SCONES.
what.
why? :( because of the bomb threat?
-_-
ooh actually apparently it's going to thunder.
umm i am but i have a thing that evening.
and then we can't make scones :( because my parents will be home for dinner.
and they're not home tomorrow.
m.
ok but don't kill yourself driving through a thunderstorm.
the thing starts at 7:30 but i can be late.
but then we can't make scoooooones :( :( :(.
um because my parents aren't home tomorrow so we would be fending for ourselves.
therefore scones for dinner.
but on friday my mom is making dinner.
and won't want us using the kitchen.
haa.
i'll just make scones tomorrow when they're not home and save one for you.
-_-
what.
come at 3 and leave at 4?
or would you come earlier.
ooh yeah!
also, for the 20th: my parents like to get to the airport really early because they're paranoid about missing flights. we're probably going to leave at 7:45 and get there at 9:20. what were your plans? you can come with us if you want but idk if you wanna get there that early.
ok well didn't you say you'd have to leave at 4 anyway?
or is that your thing.
ha.
so you'll be very late...
what is it?
ok whatever works for you.
YAY ok so if you get here in the afternoon then WE CAN MAKE SCONES.
