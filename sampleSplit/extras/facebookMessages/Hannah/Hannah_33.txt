wow weird.
w/e.
you owe me a soda.
or a yogurt.
or something.
because i called it.
ok fine you don't god you are so difficult.
I ALREADY ABSOLVED YOU OF YOUR DEBT.
WHY WERE YOU TRYING NOT TO HURT MY FEELINGS.
THAT IMPLIES SOMETHING HURTFUL NEEDS TO BE BLUNTED.
you give it to me straight and i give it to you straight, fair's fair.
scaaaaarborough fair.
ok there there have a cookie.
HA yeah so low cut.
also we determined it was ferns, not feathers.
but ok ok, that was very considerate of you.
i thank thee.
namaste.
so did your sister send you that iliad thing?
knew it.
don't mean nothin.
bitches aint shit and they aint sayin nothin.

i mean to bed.
urgh i'm not even tired.
and i have to shower.
so early!!
why is it weird, we've done it plenty of times before.
ha.
i was about to say!!!
hopefully not bad, right? at least from ~3:00 onwards?
ok well i'm not saying ??? because i don't want you to think i'm trying to coddle your feelings.
but ???
are you kidding me.
fine, i rescind it.
you just said you feel insulted!!!!
?,???????
then why did you say you appreciate it.
ok fine dear god i will just be completely blunt with you from now on and never say anything nice to you ever.
actually i agree, duibuqi sounds worse than sorry.
but is it worse than "i'm sorry" ?
yes i think it still is.
ok but you can't completely fault me for saying that when YOU totally were doing the same thing when you said it was the triangles of my dress you didn't like.
no it's not.
you just insulted my boobs.
i insulted your entire personage.
BETTER?? IS THIS BETTER????
i feel bad now.
BUT I CAN'T SAY SORRY!!!
GODDAMMIT.
nothing i take it back.
i feel no remorse.
(for saying it was an insult to your entire personage).
i just answered it.
(for saying it was an insult to your entire personage).
ugh.
show some emotion, jane.
yeah i dunno either that was just a gratuitous dig.
so are you mad at me for saying sorry.
hao.
thursday good?
wait that would be the 13th.
that's a long time from now.
ok are we talking about the 6th?
*oh.
oh ha ha, hao.
ummm but then i can't stay over.
only day i could stay over would be tuesday-wednesday.
which is what you suggested in the first place...
lolol.
har har ok i'll have to check with my parents.

they might ask where i'm sleeping.
i'd probably be on the floor of your room, right?
no?
yes.
hahaha.
ok ok, scratch that, guest bedroom.
