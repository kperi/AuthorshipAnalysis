normally i would but it's going to be hot tomorrow.
i'd rather freeze to death in the movie theater so i can curl up in a little ball.
cats don't like the heat.
can't you bring pets.
ugh this movie theater sucks.
you are mean.
i know plenty of humans who would be more than willing to adopt me.
yours is 11:34; mine is 11:44.
ohh.
hmm.
i was just going to bring more crackers.
we can do lunch!!! what is wrong with you.
even better: cracker picnic in central park.
perf.
ok i have to go now but yeah lunch sounds good.
lunch as in lunch.
do you want to just meet up at the train station then? if we're doing lunch first?
well when did you want to get lunch?
before or after getting our visas?
whyyyyy are you taking so long to respond.
hao.
oh oops crap i thought it reopened at 12. hah it reopens at 1.
oh really?? what did you think?
also do we want that much time to eat then? that's more than an hour.
!! what's wrong with you!!
no i'm not talking to you if you're driving, i refuse to be the cause of your death. i'll see you tomorrow at penn station at 11:44!
you're not still driving, are you?
you were doing it before........
ok whatever.
anyway i just meant that if we get there at 11:44 we have more than an hour till the embassy reopens.
12:24 for me, 12:33 for you.
10:58 and 11:18, respectively.
w/e let's just stick with the 11:34/44.
yeah.
ok.
hao.
are we just going to find somewhere to eat on our way?
can we talk about this tomorrow i'm tiiiireed.
i meant talk in person.
ok hao hao good night!!!!!! i go to bed.

yeah it's not difficult.
btw devon was the one i thought was completely unattractive, not kelsey dennison... got confused, they kind of look alike.
are you reading these introduction emails being sent from other PiB?s? ughh all these words i don't know.
you're probably fine tbh.
i don't think i've forgotten much.
oh haha yeah sure.
it's so frustrating because it looks like it'll take 2 seconds to read and then it actually takes 2 minutes...
yep.

i'll try to go to bed soon-ish.
i should still be somewhat tired.
omg what.
ok i'm going to bed too.
