i prolly would have been competitive with you about grades actually.
yeah i mean i was far and away the smartest person in my grade.
wow that sounded really conceited.
but what i meant was that i was used to getting the best grades so i probably would have felt threatened.
if there had been somebody just as smart as i was.
STOP.
oh phew.
i always forget to check whether you set those things to private.
NO.
you were salutatorian, nice try.
haha really?

no.
actually well i think if we'd grown up together probably i wouldn't have been competitive with you.
alwlwl.

no that's what i was saying.
but if you felt somebody was there who was worthy of competition.
then, maybe.
no you didn't.
