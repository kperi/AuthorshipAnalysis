the burden of having the loco-est parents.
loco-est.
locust.
okee i'll see you friday then!!
yeah.
a few hundred at the airport in beijing, the rest probably at the bank they mentioned in the handbook.
buying one there.
did you read the handbook????
no.......... -_-
oh did you want to figure out couchsurfing stuff.
yeah i did it was such a pain.
no but do you want to figure out couchsurfing stuff.
tonight.
yeah i can forward it to you.
sent.
and i don't remember.
where does it say that?
what did you not realize that?
yes.
how did you not realize this?
we're doing 107-108.
it is.
one academic year..
...
and yeah you register here https://step.state.gov/step/.
it's pretty quick.
nope.
aw "hannah i can't do this" so panic-stricken.
can we do this couchsurfing thing now.
PICK UP MY CALL.
"call dropped".
ugh.
...
you are bizarre and weird.
MM i thought of a good way to say it: ????????????
also frances ha was playing at the garden theater.
yep last night.
seeing people.
i just realized.
if we get back the morning of the 8th.
we have to move our stuff in that same day.
because classes start on the 9th.
so before we leave we need to have our stuff ready for princeton too.
oh really?
ooh yeah you're right.
phew.
yeah.
umm are you going to lug your computer around with you when we're traveling?
idk it might be useful.
you wouldn't be able to use your iphone would you?
omg also get this.
so i was mistaken.
we arrive on the morning of the 7th.
so we actually end up traveling BACKWARDS IN TIME.
because we leave taipei at 11:40 on september 6th.
and we get to california at 8:10 on SEPTEMBER 6TH.
!!
P.M.
oh >.<.
weiyang accepted our couchsurfing request!!!! :D https://www.couchsurfing.org/people/weiyang1/.
he says (via google translate): Hello! See your letter I am very pleased, looking forward to your arrival.
