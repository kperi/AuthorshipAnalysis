what are we doing tomorrow.
wait so we're hanging out in pennington?
DID YOU WATCH THE VIDEO.
i do like the album.
it's very chill.
instant crush is good.
what time tomorrow?
oohh yep that's fine.
i need to stop chain-chewing gum.
i already finished that pack of bubblemint.
yeah i'm listening to beyond right now.
i'm becoming accustomed to it.
oh good i also.
have you seen the movie amelie?
what ethnicity is lyra schweizer?
mm really she looks different.
i think you would really like amelie.
you're messing up my sleep schedule!!!!
good night.
oooh thanks.
(decided to watch another episode of ad).
haha.
well now this way if we decide to watch more i'll have to sit and wait for you!!!
i was just making it fair.
you know, there is time to read if you just make time for it.
to read all the books we used to read when we were little.
well then isn't that just a choice you've made?
aww.
you know that's on custom too, right? probably a good thing.
holy crap you made that hideous thing your cover photo AND shared it with the public.
that is not ok.
look at your cover photos.
...
omg.
remove.
i don't know but it is NOT ok.
xiexie.
shenme?
mm.
yup.
bummer.
i don't think you can set a cover photo without it being public.
yeeeeaahh.
oh well dis current one is cute.
lolol btw did you see what my friend's dad commented on that status you made for me?
"Wrong.".
thanks, ted, i was going through a really traumatic inner struggle and you just made it all better.
he's hilarious.
ugh stop trying to embarrass me.
"daway choke-ren likes your note i'm such a good friend".
how sweet.
isn't it so sad that we only have childhood once and then it's gone.
wouldn't it be nice if we could just choose to revert back to those times temporarily.
like every year.
you get one day to relive your life as a childhood.
that would be so much better.
and this time you'd actually appreciate it.
"youth is wasted on the young".
lolololol also us.
we're probably not appreciating these teenage/ young adult years as much as we should be.
HOW CAN WE APPRECIATE IT MORE.
?!?!
lolol.
yeah yeah but we don't appreciate certain things that we won't have later. you'll still have those things (movie and music appreciation) when you're older.
like right now.
we don't appreciate how we don't have gray hair.
or wrinkles.
yeah that will be.
ugh yeah pretty much.
omg that's the argument you should use next time you talk to that girl!!
1) we can copulate silently 2) we need to have sex before we start getting old and wrinkly!!!
" .... her? ".
k.
...
without saying anything?
LOL.
why didn't you just tell her?
wow you are so.
SHE ASKS YOU AGAIN.
...
.................
??????????
i can't believe she still talks to you after that.
it's just so awkward!
and i'd be insulted probably.
well it'd be pretty obvious.
ugh.
you are.
hahaha.
but now you do want to hook up with her.
just when she's not "red", is that right?
.....
you are a bad person.
sigh.
i guess not.
that's dumb.
i see no profit in this exercise.
it's like the food challenge but worse.
"trying to see how stupidly i can hit on her"? what is the point of that?
