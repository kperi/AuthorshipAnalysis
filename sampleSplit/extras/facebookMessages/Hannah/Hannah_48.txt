ugh i just want to make them proud.
i need to figure out my life.
i feel like everyone i know does.

my friend peter is going into cognitive linguistics and he has this perfect internship he's doing this summer.
my sister's premed.
why the fuck is everyone premed.
yes it is.
BUT I WON'T BE SUCCESSFUL IF I DON'T FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M DOING.
and if i'm not successful i can't make them proud.
