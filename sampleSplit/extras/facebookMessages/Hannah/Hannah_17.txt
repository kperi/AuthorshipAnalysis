famous piece, you've probably heard it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSHwX2O7j2w.
have you heard of martha argerich? or this piece?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCSEwfqs-VM.
both are incredible.
most of the stuff we listen to today (i.e., that has survived the test of time) is really really awesome.

HAHA i just wanted to see your reaction.
LOL.
did you listen to the liszt/ paganini?
hahaha.
ok i'm thinking.
umm who is she what does she look like.
i need a picture.
are you ashamed.
I'M THINKING.
let me consult my game blogs.
wow you are rude.
HAHA no do you want to seem butthurt.
awesome, right??
do you think she got it and is ignoring it?
also i don't understand, do you have the house to yourself?
ok i'm thinking.
is she a regular booty call?
"i can copulate in silence" - dcr, 5/25/13.
hahahaha. uh...
how about just a simple "you still up? come over".
i would laugh.
wait what are you saying.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s.
no periods.
brb.
how long has it been since she replied.
did you listen to the beethoven.
i mean since you sen tit.
hah, tit.
i actually played that one.
this one too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2q8-Sr__A.
????
i think that's a fine response... if you think she's awake and is just ignoring it...
tell me when you're done with the brahms.
wait what?
ok??
-______-
that was so dumb.
you're so dumb.
are you done with the brahms?
-_-
here's a longer one.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0odaG9qi818.
yeah 8 hours home and you already miss me ugh typical.
actually before you start that.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7M5FKmHqqg.
right.
are you listening to the grieg?
i have no conception of money.
i have no idea how much my house cost.
man that was a really good performance of the grieg, i'm going to listen again.
god i didn't play it nearly that well.
i think i was too young when i learned it.
i should go back to it.
location, location.
did you like the grieg?
yep it's a fast piece.
wait listen to the liszt now.
the hungarian rhapsody.
the same way you remember any other piece's...
btw i was the one who recommended piazzolla to you.
oh yeah no i don't really know those.
or like.
i do know that that one is #2.
but only because i haven't listened to the others that much.
some of them have nicknames.
so beethoven op 27 #2 is the moonlight sonata.
and liszt /paganini etude s. 161 no. 3 is la campenella.
and chopin etude op. 10 no. 1 is the waterfall etude.
yeah sometimes.
like i remembered that pollini does a really good performance of the waterfall etude.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk6s7KXFTAQ.
yeah of course.
uhhh idk.
to give you some idea, my knowledge of repertoire is fairly slim.
like... 5%?
what/.
?
what does "hm" mean?
you should really listen to the whole waldstein if you can: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL0JLNt_3EE.
