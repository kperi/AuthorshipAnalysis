whaaat dianna is just how i pictured rosamond.
probably will.
what about you.
yes do you not like him??
oh yeah i like lydgate too.
and mary.
fred is fine.
why don't you like ladislaw?
yeah but do you remember the part where will is reflecting on how causabon did a wrong to dorothea in marrying her.
i'm not saying he's totally right but i can see his point.
ok i disagree but whatever.
ooh what are they.
ugh i've never heard of any of these.
oh mm.
hold on watching the trailer for synechdoche.
this looks interesting.
:o.
watching the oslo trailer now.
this looks scary/ depressing.
um btw i just remembered we didn't look up couchsurfing for huashan.
oh wait are we going from huashan to lijiang and then surfing there?
oh wait are we going to huashan using xi'an as a base.
oh ok. so we might just get the hotel for those two nights in xi'an.
hao.
meiyou.
what.
wow.
that's pretty cool.
i just watched the trailer for the fountain.
it looks really good.
did you like it?
ok -_-
i'm tired going to bed.
wheee see you tomorrow!!!!!!
i am NOT excited.
actually a valid concern, i will set an alarm.
gooooood night.
you're exactly like lydgate.
i guess it would be more accurate to say "you remind me of lydgate".
large white hands.
the pursuit of scientific achievement.
desire to do something meaningful with respect to science.
you be lydgate, and i'll be will.
a dilettante unsure of what to do with his/her life.
that means i have to try opium at some point.
actually yes she'd probably be my first choice.
bertha mason a close second!!!
"useful" of course the criteria you use.
somebody else used that as a word to describe people... oh yeah, karen.
she's taking this class too!
it's just funny to hear it applied to people.
hahahaha.
that's not happening.
