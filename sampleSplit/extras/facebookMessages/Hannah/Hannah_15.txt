something you might find enlightening: http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/04/09/upstream_color_faq_analysis_and_the_meaning_of_shane_carruth_s_film.html.

moonrise kingdom looks so good.
did you start the terrence malick yet?

khvnmnbm.

hahaha oh nooo.
chi 303, chm 305, mat 202, eng 345 (-_-/:D).
ugh that did not work.
( -_- / :D ).
wow you are the nicest.
and yes because i am a good friend.
LOOK AT ME PUTTING EFFORT INTO THIS FRIENDSHIP!!!!!
ya ya switched around my lab time for you and everything. although i saw on ice that 312 easily fits into your schedule... but i guess the issue was you didn't want to take chaucer.
yes -_-
ugh daway!
...
...
then i'll switch my lab schedule again and take 312.
i guess.
you should take it.
our friendship will be more thoroughly sustained if we have a class together.
312 is probably less work.
hao.
k what about phy 103vs 105.
is mat 202 really hard?
mm.
ok.
-_-
but you're good at math.
hm.
*eye roll*.
hahaha.
HA.
you're welcome!!! (????!).
mm.
what did i say?
oh yeah.
i have to pee so badly but my bed is so comfy.
hahahaha.
omg.
hahahahaha.
i love reina.
is she still there?
i was thinking about it and i probably won't be able to take it next semester.
the phy/mat/chm/chi is a lot already.
and then eng 345 will be a considerable amount of reading/writing.
i wouldn't be able to do a good job on it.
i really have to pee.
brb.
hahaaha.
you're taking it.
cue the "awwwwww".
yes i am sustaining our friendship plz be appreciative.
