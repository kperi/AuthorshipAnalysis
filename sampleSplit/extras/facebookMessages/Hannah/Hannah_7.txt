yay!!!!!!!
as davy would say.
gimme knucks.
plz.
omg calm down!!!
cm.
i have our chat up in a separate window so it registers as "seen" even when i haven't actually read it yet.
-_-
dawww.
i decided to sleep a little, so...
ugh i shouldn't even be on fb.
haha you are probably so disgusted by my work ethic, or lack thereof.
i would like a kitty with a nice soft stomach I could pet and lay my head on.
too bad i'm allergic.
i suppose i could lay my head on a hairless cat's stomach but that would be.
a little less enjoyable.
ooooh.
puppyyy.
do you still feel awkward?
is that a no?
:D.
well now i'm sitting with you.
oh really.
wait i felt bad leaving though.
since i did bring you to forbes...
yeah but...
it wasn't really cool.
of me.
i mean it still makes more sense than sitting a table awat.
away.
ok whatever.
well because i told him i felt bad not sitting with you.
and he was like "oh you can sit with him if you want" but obviously would have been annoyed if i did.
so then he was like "tell him to sit here".
in 20 years i will look back on this conversation and think it was so stupid.
can i have another cart.
cat.
xiexie.
are you kidding you guys are tan lian ai-ing.
i mean tan de lai lololol.
russian-chinese?? niiiiiice.
actually fanzheng = anyway.
so maybe that does work??
idk.
uhh i haven't had it yet.
you mean the midterm?
supposedly "in class" but it's on the 20th.
how would i know -_-
uhh probably not.
it's a good class, just take it.
