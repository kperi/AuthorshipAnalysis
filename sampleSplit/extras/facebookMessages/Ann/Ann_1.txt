how did your project go?
hmm.
when do you leave for pton?
wait that's awks.
that's when i move in to columbia.
how are we gonna move in two people the same day?
i mean i guess we could.
but that'd bea really intense day for mom.
i can just move in the next day.
no biggie.
do you know who you're romming with?
weird in a cool way?
aw.
where are they from?
the weird/normal is weird in a not cool way?
is this the sheltered or the weird/normal?
it's actually better to be friendly aquaitances with your roommates.
(unless you're best friends0.
where are they from?
no.
you really have to read for the rest of your life.
yea.
yeah.
literary isn't a subject.
but yeah i know what you mean.
just checking to make sure you knew that.
have you met any people in ny?
do you like them?
ok its good you recognize that.
maybe.
we'll see if i'm still alive.
what lunch place?
ehh im not gonna go.
too much traveling.
dude.
i've been traveling for like 17 hours already.
and i still have another like 17 hours ahead of me.
and i haven't slept at all.
also i have like 10 loads of laundry to do.
and i start work on monday.
morgan stanley?
who is that chiung-yin liu person who you and mom friended? she friended me to.
*too.
that's what i assumed too.
ok.
uh oh.
why were you scared? I thought you were doing fine.
daway, why are you doing so badly?
your classes are below your ability.
you shouldn't be in intro cs.
you shouldn't be in 201.
you also took intro chinese.
bc you took ap calc bc.
and got a 5.
bc you do know some chinese.
so shouldn't you be in 203 then?
yea, you've also done so many math programs.
idk, i'm just saying that it troubles me that you're so quick to drop down.
fine.
but note that you are now in the lowest level of all the classes you could take.
you have no reason to be doing badly, except laziness.
ok, so you have one advnaced class.
so you should have enough time to do well in your classes.
yes, don't use that as an excuse.
so be in the top 30%.
why is that hard?
top 30% is still a lot of people.
30% is not that elite.
bc all physics are honors kids?
so be an honors kid.
i don't understand why you have such low expectations for yourself.
it's your freshman year, don't compromise!
i compromised a lot, and i'm telling you not to.
fine that's smart.
don't tell me to shut up.
you yourself said you wanted to drop down to 201 so you had more time to hang out.
"and ann i dropped to math 201. 203 was just taking up so much time and i want to have more time to do the prince/have fun ".
and have fun.
which is fine and important, but don't use that as an excuse for bad grades.
it's so important to have a good gpa.
i'm saying all of this for your own good.
ok so how'd you do on your physics test.
ok, do you know why?
daway, i know i'm being harsh, but i just have high expectations for you.
yes, why did they do better?
i think it is.
its' not x hours.
but you can always read more and practic emore problems right?
where on the bell curve were you for the physics exam?
it's about application.
i know.
you're not dumb though.
i think you are smart enough for this stuff.
