i need help.
i need the help of a funny person.

and i need a witty/funny title.
like this is a real serious thing.
i have one of those old school funny but mean profs.
and he loves witty/funny titles.
demands them.
and reads them all in fron to fhte class.
so as of now, my title is: "Quarto? more like Quart-NO!!!".
