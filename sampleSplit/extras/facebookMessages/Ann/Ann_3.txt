i will probably have to go with you.
unless my ballot comes in the mail in the next two days.
iono.
your ballot must be received before close of polls.
by the county board of elections.
yeah i guess.
unless you can hand-deliver it?
ok 300 Halls Mill Road, Freehold.
is the address of where we go to get a ballot.

ok you're right.
dud.
*dude.
kriek lambic.
um idk.
probs.
and ya it's $14 for a big bottle.
not cheap at all.
but it's $14..
1 pint and like 9 oz haha.
not even.
it's like a wine bottle.
a decent $14 beer is way better than a mediocre $14 wine.
what's the occasion?
cute.
that'll be cheaper i'm sure.
where do you guys go out?
well why go out less?
you can def go out once a week as long as you're working hard.
um anyway, so i'm not really a beer expert.
but i like blue moon.
but i'm a girl.
i also like stella.
(stella artois).
ok yeah.
um stella's not like, amazing.
(kriek lambic is god).
but it's decent.
i had a really great porter last night too, i'm trying to find it.
it's a very dark ale.
ok w/e i don't remember its name.
um idk, i think it actually just comes from the type of malt that is brewed.
light malt = pale ale.
dark malt = porters/stouts.
what's the street like?
do you have to be drinking there?
why?
i'm sure not everyone drinks.
idk, why do you speak in such absolutes.
fair enough.
no.
i'm with you.
what are the other options besides the street?
or is that why you and your suitemates want to drink in your suite more?
that's nice.
what have you seen?
i heard the master is very good.
i also saw seven psychopaths.
which was surprisingly good.
and argo.
how was nyu?
pton is more communal?
lol?
ok.
hmm.
yea.
that's really strange to me.
well that might change.
do you have fun?
hm ok.
oh and circling back to before, the brand of kriek lambic is lindemann's.
lambic is a type of beer.
kriek just means black cherry.
also it's really sweet, tastes like jolly ranchers (in a good way).
doesn't taste like beer.
howsa life?
anything new?
how are you doing in school?
how did your DQ paper go?
wait really?
how did you get a B/.
?
like what was the criticism.
eh maybe a B+
that's a standard rubric.
ok.
how?
so you're getting B and B+s in all your classes?
ok.
C+ in what?
how?
you dropped down.
ok.
don't go by that.
you need to have above a 3.5.
ideally a 3.6, or 3.7.
(i mean, ideally above that).
yes.
why?
daway, to be able to get a good job you need a min gpa of 3.5.
