the essay was ok, pretty solid B+ to A- class, but I haven't done shit for work in that class.
Anytime cutie.
classic CO.
actually, so true though.
Dooooppppeeee.
Seriously.
hmmm. I'm most partial to RMNP, but that's the one I am closest too.
maroon bells is more the aspen crowd.
a little more yuppie.
the scenery is still pretty stunning though.
I think RMNP has the most to do, depends on how long you will be there for.
Woah.
I could do that.
nope.
Hey dude, was trying to self study some Chinese today at work in Shanghai. Seemed like something you would do and got me wondering how you are. How are you liking Texas? Work and stuff ok for you?
hmm. I can't tell if that sounds nice or not.
what are you workin gon.
on?
I'm interning in Shanghai, was stuying in HK for a little bit.
I'll be back in HK to wrap up my program in August so yah.
HK was awesome though, relaxed time, lots of fun.
Shanghai is a little shittier. My internship is pretty boring (lots of bitch work) and the air sucks.
but I got a gym worked out and have some time to read, so its not all bad.
thats fucking sick dude.
so my messages may come through in the wrong order/not at all.
also my internet sucks.
and yah, HK was lots of fun.
did you come up with that yourself or was that assigned?
Shanghai is a little more real though, hahaha.
lol.
so you are just doing this for shits and gigs?
or do you turn something in?
HK was pretty responsbilityless.
here I have like an hour long commute.
and real work.
it's more onerous I guess.
that would be sick.
August 22nd I think.
I have about 5 and a half more weeks in Shanghai.
then HK for the rest.
this feels depressingly grown up.
but my work is pretty tedious so I'm spending most of my time doing my own reading.
um.
good.
more trendy.
you would like them more.
like, more hipster/terrace like.
found one in a huge house in a really quiet neighborhood run by this guy from amsterdam.
5 drinks upon admission, very chill, lots of interesting people.
then at about 3 AM people start dancing.
goes til 9.
basically your place.
ugh.
that's rough man.
why don't you get weekends?
ahhh, yah.
nothing to explore outside of campus?
and yah, next year it's balls to the walls for a paying job.
I'm sick of living off my college fund/parents cash.
austin is fucking dope.
no ladies?
I guess it is computer science.
hmm.
just your type?
oh.
nope.
well maybe its a surprise underneath?

I wanna see that work in the fall.
oh shit.
