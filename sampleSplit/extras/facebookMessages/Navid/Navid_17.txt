doesnt work in our situation.
its certainly logical.

Ah. Yeah dude I can tot see you two together.
How chill are her parents? And is she doing some internship this summer?
Do u think she is gonna get into ptown.
Like is she a tier above Alyssa and Brandon?
Smarter doesn't mean much if she doesn't have awards.
And Alyssa's swimming is not good lol.
Well how will schools know she is smarter than Brandon academically.
They'll both have straight a's and same sat's.
Brandon had 1 b.
Brandon's music is better than her art I'm pretty sure.
But yeah he didn't have academic awards.
Yeah def.
I didn't like Brandon's rests.
Essays.
Soccer isn't really big for him.
Grades music and some research.
But his main essay I didn't like at all.
It managed to make him seem cocky yet still.
Mediocre lol.
Like it was like being cocky about. Wing mediocre about everything.
With being *.
That was literally it.
He was saying how he s a natural at everything.
But doesn't stay on one thing do he isn't superb at anything.
Lol.
Idk jul's essay could be enter than it's.
Ur's.
Tho actual resume is worse I'm pretty sure.
Yeah ur resume was pretty good.
Very well rounded.
U mean research paper.
Or Princeton rsrch.
Ah yeah that published author status.
