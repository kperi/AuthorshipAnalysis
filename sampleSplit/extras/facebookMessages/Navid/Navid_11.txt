teh thing is.
you have to get her to come.
and drink wine with you.
thats a must.
but if you get that.
i gaurantee you.
she comes over.
cause she's touchey as fuck.
to just like chill next to you.
and if that happens.
then you just gotta lean in.
and do your magic.
the only worrying aspect.
is that its gonna be during the day.
so thats a little awk.
like i feel like it has to be kinda dark.
which it wont be till post 9.
so she has to leave.
late.
aight.
so try to eat dinner.
later.
like at 7. 7 30.
as long as you can supply.
decent conversation throughout the day.
which i think you can pretty easily.
and if you can get her to go upstairs to drink some wine.
your good.
she's def already expecting to do something.
like you dont get invited to nyc to eat dinner with a guy and hang out.
alone.
without expecting something.
amirite or amirite.
ignore me more /////.
faggot.
she'll be all touchey throughout the day too.
dw man your getting a handjob atleast.
i beleve in you ;).

Alright so what your saying, If I understand you correctly is that you think that everything that you have done has been a cold calculated move to show off what you want to show off? And not because you have done things cause you liked doing them?

The glittering objects are things you've done.
