another try.
loveless.

your.
top 5 artist.

i could maybe make.
a top 20.
that i wouldnt feel that bad about.
but top 5.
is too hard.

later.
after this album.
i liked it.
on bri side.

him*.
raw dog.
idk.
but i liked both of the status's.
ironically.
dude.
im telling u.
oedipus complex.
bri/alex so similar to parents.
give me validation.
on that theory.
fuck u nigger.
<3.
that makes me happy.
and yeah thats really ironic.
since he never friended me.
dont be.
the gay friend.
dont put urself in that stereotype.
like tbh.
if there was a guy.
i was freinds with.
and his best friends.
were girls.
i would think he's gaty.
alexa.
christina.
hmm, this is a pattern of close female friends later on in life.
fuck, black people have hip ass fashion.
it makes you hyper.
idk.
ive never experimented with that.
you got a shit ton of work tonight?

for the most part now?
this song.
reminds me.
of "walk away" by mariah carey.
ganesh transitioned socially the worst.
easily.
work wise.
work wise, maybe alex if he continues premed.
lol.
or like caitlin.
shitty worker in hs.
um maybe.
idk.
i didnt like that song that much.
it was ok.
yeah.
but like idk how hard nursing school penn is.
but if its actual hard penn.
she might get ass raped.
maybe not bad grades persay.
but like grayed hair by graduation.
lol.

sar.
i think asian males.
are especially prone to them.
im not sure if its genetic.
or a culture of high stres.
s.
