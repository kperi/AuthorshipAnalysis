lol just as you told them I said, it's true.

ur group just has a higher percentage.
we never made our ranking of ppl haha.
when I get back maybe.
how's work going.
aight ttyl might not have Internet when u get bak.
I know u admitted that to me before u said me Alex ur sis fav in ur heart and Alexa fav in ur dick.
isk if that's still ur opinion but yeh.
how are things with u and Alexa now.
u don't like her anymore or do u still?
I like how u ranked ken over Alex.
that's funny.
and yeah it was cute.
u knew that one by remembrance or did u look it up.
