so rap.
haha nice.
what was the average.
how did ur friends do.
so how do u know.
71.
is good.
no curve?
and so i remember.
u said that like.
you skipped some parts completely.
70 was like ur goal right lol.
nice then.
i bet the guy.
was surprised.
by ur limits.
shows ur smart.
if u did them correctly.
in some different way.
btw.
did u just get introduced.
to delta epsilon proofs?
yeah.
the only way we've been shown.
to proove a limit exists at some point.
is to use squeeze theorem.
and i dont really know squeeze theorem so yeah..
um.
between 2 functions.
and if the limit of those 2 func at w.e. point is x.
then limit of middle func at that point is x.
yeah..i dnt think we're gonna have to prove it.
on the exam/test.
yeah its funny.
that mr. math.
is happy.
he got a C-
on a math test.
also sad.
do u think someone in ur class got an A?
your changing daway.
closed gates of princeton.
changing who you are.
even dah math/physics majors?
poly fag?
wel you cant expect the average person their to be scholarly.
there*.
they had good resumes and some touching essay.
you can have those things.
and not be intellectual.
but theres def.
a shit ton of scholars.
ther.
e.
which ones.
lul.
well.
her personality.
is bad.
wtf.
thats some pseudo psycology.
there.
she has a personality.
its just shitty.
u always.
quote him.
lol.
yes.

unconsciously?
not bad.
lul.
fag cliques.
i decidedly.
didnt join.
the iranian club here.
even though my roommate did.
cuase i hate nationalism.
so did u find out how u did relative to others.
on math.
what did u get wrong.
id say that means.
ur 20-30th percentile.
out of 50 kids.
like for a bio test.
i got an 92.
avg was 80.
i think most people.
get within like 8 pts.
like 70%.
oh.
maybe im wrong.
30th to 40th might be right.
on the test.
did u have to do.
delta epsilon.
with 2 variables?
and so ur not dropping physics.
right?
