you could do it.
like if u look at problems.
from other books.
dude.
he;s a troll.
i swear to go.
d.
jesus christ.
do u act.
incredulous.
when he asks you?
what does andrew say.
like he explains them?
he doesnt laugh?
i would laugh.
jesus christ.
doesnt andrew have.
better things to do.
than explain this shit.
LOL.
i thoiught it was funny.
but too much disconnect form when u im'd me.
http://boards.4chan.org/mu/res/29406655.
lolthis is a troll thread.
i started on /mu/.
i love /r/music parody.
not necessarily.
theres a lot.
of reddit thread pictures.
posted.
on /mu/ humor threadds.
but yeah.
they prob have.
i think there are a lot of redditors.
on /mu/ in general.
dude.
that kids.
just.
...
did u have math lecture today?
did you like learning actual multi var.
instead of some abstract shiut for smarties.
yeah.
you should still.
go to the other class.
i think its worth the drop for gpa.
cause like.
you really werent ready for that.
next semester you might be ready for some high level shit.
but that was too mcuh.
you can skip that?
but u see.
isnt what u learn.
so differnet.
hows ur physics calss?
is that abstract too?
is it advanced?
i think.
that advanced shit.
was way harder.
than what we did in high school.
but what ur in now.
isnt that much harder.
yeah i was the same...
i study.
a lot for math now.
ive managed not to do any hw yet.
in my calc class.
but ive studied a lot.
yeah.
he doesnt collect hw.
and the types of problems on the test.
which require some higher thinking or w.e.
he normally adresses.
in the notes.
so if u understnad all the notes.
u can do well on the test.
while ppl who dont fully understand the notes.
and do all the hw.
dont do as well.
lol i thought of you today.
caus, like usual, my calc teacher.
was talking about engineers.
are so unprecise.
and in general dont have deeper understanding.
saying they use buzzwords.
without kowing what they mean exactly.
but to be fair.
he also said this.
about physics majors.
he said if u wanna really have a deeper understanding about physics.
u gotta major in math.
and then apply to physics.
he actually does research.
in quantum mechanics.
wait ur actually going after that.
well, to be honest, if you wanna understnad the math behind physics well, you dont need number theory, rather, you will need a deeper understanding of linear algebra, group theory, partial differential equations, functional analysis, topology, tensor analysis, bifurcation theory, etc.
atleast those are the important ones.
dude imma genius.
>smart.
