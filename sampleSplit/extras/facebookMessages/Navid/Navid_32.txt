so utsav was with jmarino.
early junior year.
and utsav wanted to give girl advice to james.
he said you always gotta have a safety, a target, and a reach.
his were alexa as a safety, mimi as a target, and briana benton as a reach.
i think thats funny.
for many reasons.
1. the fact that that is good advice and he thought he was a genius with girls.
2 that alexa was his safety.
when'd u ask alexa out.
