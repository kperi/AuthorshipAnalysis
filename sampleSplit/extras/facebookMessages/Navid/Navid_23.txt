over the top.
lol.
how old are the kids.
how do you know tat.
lol.
show offs.
lol.
what did yyou think.
of the kids.
and what did they major in?
rich dale.
lul.
i love how they live on the side of wealth and success.
and the other side of the lake.
is brookdale.
lol.
i wonder if they did that on purpose.
with the dale's.
lol.
the ones.
that are north on richdale.
are good.
what did the parents.
major in?
i mean.
i wonder.
how often that happens.
nowdays.
and the rate of failure.
like how often do you think people do that.
and then just fail.
like i feel like that type of going and getting ur mba.
midway in your carreer.
would only be relatively safe if you are accepted into a top 5 mba place.
like wharton and shit.
where you are gaurantee'd big money.
even if it isnt super big.
I mean the MBA school.
nvm yeah i agree with you.
but about the mba school.
i wonder what these people's resumes were like.
like how they got into the mba.
school.
at a top school like that.
like if they took.
finance shit.
in grad/undergrad.
at one poiunt.
yeah its up there.
but internships.
and stuff like.
that.
and regardless.
thats till.
5-10 yrs ago.
from your pre-engineering college/grad days.
