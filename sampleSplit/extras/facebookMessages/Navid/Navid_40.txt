so if the func was going to 0,0.
along y=z.
its just 0.
i mean.
i didnt prove it.
or anything.
lol.
like with a theorem.
just plugged in some lines.
1 sec.
lol.
the second one.
if u did it.
along x axis.
and then along x=y, when z=0.
you'd get two diff limits.
now idk really how to prove limits exist.
only way we've shown it definitieviyl.
is squeeze theorem.
why shouldnt it?
if u do it along x axis.
y=0, z=0, your limit is x^2/x^2 = 1.
when x=y, z=0.
you get x^2/x^2+x^2.
which equals 1/2.
so it dne.
ive never heard.
of cylindrical coordinates before.
no.
x=y, and z=0.
in the first one.
um.
if you do it along y=z.
you get z^4/2z^2.
thats 0.
thats how we learned it.
lol.
but it doesnt prove anything.
cause u cant technically show every single curve.
that goes to 0.
yeah its good for disprove.
no.
lolol.
smart fags.
yes i agree.
but als you cant blame em.
college is supposed to be exciting.
i just hate fb fags.
dude.
that was so much.
teenage angst.
in one comment.
they're excited.
just cause everyone is excited.
doesnt mean they cant be excited.
you're so cute.
lol.
i spent the last like 20 minutes.
trying to understand delta epsilon proofs.
-.-
fail.
why?
loli just ask.
my smart ass roommate.
to explain stuff to me.
and he takes out his whiteboard.
and trys to explain.
it worked well for vectors.
but this delta epsilon proofs.
fak.
alright later.
try to control some of that angst.
<3.
that made me laugh.
how does it feel to have your comedic prowess validated by me.
your future.
your future is directly impacted by everything you do right now.
futur success.
*.
and ur fucking it up.
just think of the penthouse.
let that motivate u.
yeah imma go watch it. free pizza where try are showing t.
it lol.
u think mitts gonna get shit on.
or do u think hell hold his ground.
I'm curious cuz he's good at talking.
well they both r.
when are u gonna take.
number theory.
oldish articl ebut interesting if u havent seen it before:http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/confessions-of-an-ivy-league-frat-boy-inside-dartmouths-hazing-abuses-20120328.
what are those?
nvr heard of em.
lol'd a lot.
the moderator.
was retarded.
i think romney did better.
obama's closing statemnt.
absolutely.
blowe.
