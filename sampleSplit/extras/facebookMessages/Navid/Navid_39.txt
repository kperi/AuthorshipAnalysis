when u took it.
fuck dude.
smart people.
u guys.
are getting assfucked.
if u got first two parts right.
u can beat him.
didnt find out yet?
alright.
good night then.
what was the average?
that's good I guess.
means ur not in the bottom in physics.
now to see ur first math exam.
u had a math too?
take home is really?
that's weird.
it's def very widespread tho.
cheating i mean.
I was reading some article about how op tier schools have a lot of cheating cuz of stress.
if it was high school I'd expect like 90% to some extent.
in high school kids like Alyssa even cheated.
especially if the exams supper hard.
and I it has a large weight.
how's other classes going. any grades?
nice.
out of your class?
oh gotcha.
partial derivatives and chain rule concepts. our lecturer was sick tho so were a lil bbjnd.
behind.
lololol.
what did u learn then?
nah I haven't.
our lectures are messed up lol we had 2 silent lectures cause he lost his voice and we missed one completely.
cuz he was sick so he hasn't been doing Anything complicated.
oh sar.
so bowen's having a lot of trouble too.
yet i dont think u guys are gonna do that badly.
face it your gonna get a B in math.
B+?
and its advanced.
so its good.
he's in calc 3?
how'd he get into ptown.
lol.
alright.
really?
what were the questions like.
id think someone smart like you.
with infiniite.
time could do well.
even if proofs are tough.
they give u a homework, timed exam.
weird.
what were the question like.
questions like.
what exactly was the problem.
alright i get the planes bisecting one.
its like u get normal vectors to each plane,and the sum of those should be on the plane right.
and then u take the line of intersection.
yeah email it to me.
so.
ur not gonna drop it.
number 1 i coud do for the most part.
i didnt understand the sphere problem.
but thats cuz im dumb.
that cissoid..lul.
then the limits are just limits.
number 2.
was doesnt exist right?
number 1.
was 0?
its cause if u set it coming in to 0.
then the last question.
isnt it just u set like.
x=y.
x-0.
y=0.
and see what the limit is.
along those curves.
its just computation.
um.
what ur supposed to do.
is like see what the limit is.
along different curves.
