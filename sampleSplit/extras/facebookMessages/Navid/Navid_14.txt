lul.
lolol.
yeah i think she's a decent match.
for you.
to be honest.
she's def less classical girlfriend, submissive to boyfriend type too.
like she isnt one of those "let my man support me" types.
which is good.
according to tom cmal.
submissive ppl in real life are agressive in bed.
and vice versa.
so maybe.
i guess tom camal was wrong.
yep.
maybe.
i kinda told ken and james that id hang out with them tomorrow.
a while ago.
so depends whats goes there.
