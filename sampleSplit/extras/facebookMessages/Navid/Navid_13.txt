some true nyc's here.
Top of the Rock at Rockefeller is far better, cheaper, faster for viewing the city than the Empire State building: The view from the Top of the Rock is far better and cleaner than the old Empire State building. The line is usually very short, no more than 10 minutes which makes it very easy to time yourself for a sunset. The Empire State building can have wait times of upwards of 2 hours and is double the price.
u shud take jelena ther.
