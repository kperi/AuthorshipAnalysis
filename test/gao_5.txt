MOTIVATION	NN


Data	NNS
management	NN
,	,
broadly	RB
construed	VBN
to	TO
encompass	VB
all	DT
kinds	NNS
of	IN
data	NNS
,	,
has	VBZ
exploded	VBN
in	IN
the	DT
past	JJ
ten	CD
or	CC

Once	RB

furthermore	RB

even	RB
within	IN
large	JJ

many	JJ
more	JJR

with	IN
data	NNS
and	CC
the	DT
data	NNS
they	PRP
deal	VBP
with	IN
has	VBZ
more	JJR
variety	NN
.	.

A	DT
particularly	RB
prominent	JJ
kind	NN
of	IN
data	NNS
is	VBZ
unstructured	JJ
data	NNS
,	,
which	WDT
we	PRP
take	VBP
to	TO
include	VB
text	NN

so	RB
forth	RB

In	IN
view	NN
of	IN
this	DT
,	,
it	PRP
is	VBZ
disconcerting	VBG
that	IN
our	PRP$
community	NN
plays	VBZ
only	RB
a	DT
peripheral	JJ
role	NN
in	IN
most	JJS
of	IN
this	DT
data	NNS
.	.


Of	IN
course	NN
,	,
our	PRP$
community	NN
has	VBZ
long	RB
lamented	VBN
that	IN
large	JJ
chunks	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
data	NNS
space	NN
,	,
especially	RB
those	DT
dealing	VBG
with	IN
Web	NN
data	NNS
,	,
remain	VBP
outside	JJ
of	IN
our	PRP$
purview	NN
.	.

But	CC
somehow	RB
today	NN
the	DT
problem	NN
is	VBZ
even	RB
more	RBR
galling	JJ
,	,
perhaps	RB
because	IN
of	IN
the	DT
tremendous	JJ
success	NN
of	IN
companies	NNS
like	IN
Google	NNP

Yahoo	NNP
,	,
Mi	NNP

and	CC

These	DT

are	VBP
making	VBG
enormous	JJ

with	IN
the	DT
basic	JJ

Once	RB

principles	NNS
that	WDT

For	IN

we	PRP

The	DT

that	IN
in	IN
many	JJ
cases	NNS
we	PRP
have	VBP
run	VBN

situations	NNS
where	WRB
it	PRP

this	DT
something	NN

For	IN

in	IN

Similarly	RB

it	PRP

The	DT

Furthermore	RB

One	CD
example	NN
is	VBZ

we	PRP

Another	DT

use	VB
the	DT

In	IN

we	PRP
