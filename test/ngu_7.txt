The	DT

The	DT

This	DT

allows	VBZ

from	IN

specifying	VBG
both	CC

It	PRP
also	RB
provides	VBZ
operations	NNS
to	TO
create	VB

Introduction	NN


In	IN
recent	JJ

we	PRP
have	VBP
witnessed	VBN
a	DT
rapid	JJ
growth	NN
of	IN

such	JJ

The	DT

been	VBN
intensiï	JJ

and	CC
the	DT
rapid	JJ

in	IN

On	IN
the	DT
other	JJ
hand	NN
,	,
the	DT
software	NN
that	WDT
manages	VBZ
multimedia	NNS
data	NNS
is	VBZ
still	RB
far	RB
from	IN
satisfactory	JJ
.	.

Early	RB
multimedia	NNS
software	NN
concentrated	VBD
primarily	RB
on	IN
the	DT
presentation	NN
of	IN

data	NNS
,	,
dealing	VBG
with	IN
such	JJ
issues	NNS
as	IN

of	IN

More	RBR
important	JJ
in	IN
the	DT
long	JJ

,	,
however	RB

will	MD
be	VB
software	NN
that	WDT
provides	VBZ

cient	JJ
storage	NN
and	CC
retrieval	NN
of	IN
multimedia	NNS
data	NNS

especially	RB
content-based	JJ

.	.

The	DT
problem	NN
of	IN
developing	VBG
such	JJ
software	NN
has	VBZ
been	VBN
attracting	VBG
much	JJ
attention	NN
in	IN
recent	JJ
years	NNS

Image-based	JJ
multimedia	NNS
data	NNS
can	MD
be	VB
treated	VBN
in	IN
many	JJ
different	JJ
ways	NNS
.	.

One	CD
approach	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO
consider	VB
visual	JJ
properties	NNS
of	IN
images	NNS
such	JJ
as	IN
colour	NN
,	,
texture	NN
,	,
shape	NN
,	,
and	CC
so	RB
on	IN
.	.

This	DT
allows	VBZ
us	PRP
to	TO
ask	VB
queries	NNS
such	JJ
as	IN
â	JJ
$	$
œFind	JJ
all	DT
images	NNS
that	WDT
are	VBP
mainly	RB

or	CC

œFind	JJ

a	DT

of	IN
colors	NNS
similar	JJ
to	TO
this	DT
example	NN
imageâ	NN
$	$
.	.

The	DT
â	JJ
$	$
œvisual-featuresâ	JJ
$	$
approach	NN
has	VBZ
been	VBN
actively	RB
pursued	VBN
for	IN
some	DT
time	NN
and	CC
has	VBZ
yielded	VBN
some	DT
useful	JJ

e.g.	FW
QBIC	FW
-LSB-	-LRB-
11	CD
-RSB-	-RRB-
-RRB-	-RRB-
.	.


Another	DT
approach	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO
consider	VB
the	DT
semantic	JJ
composition	NN
of	IN
images	NNS
in	IN
terms	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
individual	JJ
objects	NNS
contained	VBN
in	IN
them	PRP
and	CC
the	DT
spatial	JJ
relationships	NNS
among	IN
these	DT
objects	NNS
.	.

This	DT
would	MD
enable	VB
us	PRP
to	TO
ask	VB
queries	NNS
such	JJ
as	IN
â	JJ
$	$
œFind	JJ
images	NNS
that	WDT
show	VBP

that	WDT
show	VBP
a	DT
river	NN
running	VBG
beneath	IN
a	DT
rough	JJ

$	$
.	.

Note	VB
that	IN
these	DT
queries	NNS
incorporate	VB
visual	JJ
properties	NNS
as	RB
well	RB
as	IN
spatial	JJ
relationships	NNS
between	IN
objects	NNS

The	DT

For	IN

we	PRP
would	MD
like	VB
to	TO
be	VB

to	TO
ask	VB

$	$

A	DT
data	NN

that	WDT
captures	VBZ
the	DT
relationships	NNS

will	MD
allow	VB

thus	RB
provide	VBP

So	RB

however	RB

The	DT

with	IN

Since	IN
