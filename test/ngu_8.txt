Yet	RB
another	DT
possibility	NN
for	IN
establishing	VBG

,	,
one	CD
related	JJ

is	VBZ
to	TO
develop	VB
a	DT

for	IN
cooperative	JJ
information	NN
systems	NNS
by	IN
using	VBG
a	DT
semantic	JJ

approach	NN

However	RB
,	,
semantic	JJ
reconstruction	NN
is	VBZ
not	RB
possible	JJ
using	VBG
the	DT

develop	VB
the	DT
information	NN
systems	NNS
in	IN
the	DT
first	JJ

since	IN

knowledge	NN
that	WDT

used	VBN
originally	RB
during	IN
the	DT
initial	JJ
specification	NN

phase	NN
is	VBZ
no	RB

as	IN
pointed	VBN

Meersman	NNP

-LRB-	-LRB-
This	DT

true	JJ
in	IN
many	JJ

This	DT
is	VBZ
because	IN
over	IN
a	DT

period	NN

use	NN

perhaps	RB

both	CC

and	CC

Here	RB
we	PRP
present	VBP
an	DT
approach	NN
that	WDT

of	IN
a	DT

This	DT

In	IN
this	DT
approach	NN
,	,
the	DT
current	JJ

is	VBZ
the	DT
kernel	NN
from	IN
which	WDT
inductions	NNS

an	DT
important	JJ
role	NN

they	PRP

the	DT
domain	NN

the	DT

each	DT

valuable	JJ

Establishing	VBG
an	DT

to	TO
gather	VB

In	IN

For	IN

Another	DT

that	IN
the	DT
