The	DT

attribute	NN

data	NNS
suggests	VBZ
several	JJ
interesting	JJ
directions	NNS
for	IN
future	JJ

First	RB
,	,
to	TO
better	JJR
model	NN
practical	JJ

,	,
the	DT
connectivity	NN
constraints	NNS
can	MD
be	VB
generalized	VBN
to	TO
suit	NN

requirements	NNS
.	.

For	IN
example	NN
,	,
the	DT
internal	JJ

constraint	NN
can	MD
be	VB
replaced	VBN
by	IN
speciï	NN
¬	CD

on	IN
any	DT

of	IN
properties	NNS
of	IN

such	JJ
as	IN
length	NN
of	IN

,	,
degree	NN
of	IN
vertices	NNS
,	,
connectivity	NN
,	,
etc.	FW
.	.

Second	RB
,	,
the	DT
relationships	NNS
can	MD
be	VB
nonbinary	JJ
,	,
and	CC
the	DT
edges	NNS
can	MD
be	VB
weighted	VBN
to	TO
indicate	VB
the	DT
degree	NN
of	IN
relationship	NN

For	IN
example	NN
,	,
friendship	NN
can	MD
go	VB
from	IN
intimate	JJ
and	CC

to	TO
just	RB
nodding	VBG
acquaintanceship	NN

The	DT
relationships	NNS
can	MD
also	RB
be	VB
nonsymmetric	JJ
such	JJ
as	IN
in	IN

or	CC
superior-subordinate	JJ

Clustering	NN

these	DT

algorithms	NNS
are	VBP

Finally	RB

we	PRP

that	IN
