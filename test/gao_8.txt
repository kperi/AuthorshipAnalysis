Our	PRP$
Cimple	JJ

suggests	VBZ
that	IN

can	MD
provide	VB
a	DT
good	JJ

in	IN

For	IN

if	IN

it	PRP

For	IN
example	NN

a	DT

especially	RB
well	RB

In	IN
the	DT
above	JJ

a	DT
major	JJ
challenge	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO

the	DT
underlying	VBG

For	IN
example	NN

conceptually	RB
a	DT
DBLife	NN
superhomepage	NN

Now	RB
suppose	VB
a	DT

a	DT
superhomepage	NN
-LRB-	-LRB-

-RRB-	-RRB-

Then	RB
we	PRP
must	MD
infer	VB
from	IN
the	DT
revised	VBN
wiki	JJ

the	DT

sequence	NN

the	DT

-LRB-	-LRB-
e.g.	FW

remove	VB
a	DT

,	,
rename	VB
an	DT
edge	NN
,	,
etc.	FW
-RRB-	-RRB-

This	DT
inference	NN
is	VBZ
non-trivial	JJ
because	IN

the	DT

Another	DT

A	DT

Another	DT
possible	JJ

is	VBZ
to	TO

that	IN
we	PRP

This	DT

the	DT

today	NN

Consequently	RB
they	PRP

But	CC
a	DT
distinguishing	JJ
characteristic	NN
of	IN
CIM	NNP

is	VBZ
that	IN

:	:
they	PRP

another	DT

and	CC
such	JJ

Hence	RB

we	PRP

To	TO
encourage	VB
social	JJ

CIM	NNP
systems	NNS
can	MD
employ	VB
a	DT
plethora	NN
of	IN

And	CC
indeed	RB
many	JJ
current	JJ
social	JJ

The	DT
main	JJ

that	IN
we	PRP

-RRB-	-RRB-

Hence	RB
,	,
we	PRP
foresee	VBP
two	CD
major	JJ
challenges	NNS

The	DT
ï	NN
¬	NN
rst	NN
challenge	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO
develop	VB
more	JJR
social	JJ
tools	NNS
,	,
on	IN
the	DT
ground	NN
that	WDT
expanding	VBG
the	DT

something	NN
they	PRP
like	VBP

and	CC
thus	RB
initiating	VBG
more	JJR
social	JJ
interaction	NN
.	.

The	DT
second	JJ
challenge	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO
develop	VB
a	DT
mechanism	NN
to	TO
system	NN
-	:
atically	RB
deploy	VB
combinations	NNS
of	IN
social	JJ
tools	NNS
in	IN
a	DT
CIM	NNP
setting	NN
,	,
evaluate	VB
their	PRP$
effectiveness	NN
in	IN
encouraging	JJ
user	NN
participation	NN
,	,
and	CC
then	RB
retain	VB
and	CC
improve	VB
the	DT
best	JJS
ones	NNS
.	.


Many	JJ
CIM	NNP
users	NNS
also	RB
interact	VBP
outside	IN
the	DT
system	NN
,	,
but	CC
traces	NNS
of	IN
such	JJ
interactions	NNS
are	VBP
often	RB
captured	VBN
in	IN
the	DT
raw	JJ
data	NNS
.	.

For	IN
example	NN
,	,
if	IN
X	NN
appears	VBZ
on	IN
the	DT
PC	NN
of	IN
a	DT
workshop	NN
organized	VBN
by	IN
Y	NN
,	,
then	RB
it	PRP
is	VBZ
likely	JJ
that	IN
X	NN
and	CC
Y	NN
have	VBP
exchanged	VBN
emails	NNS
and	CC
are	VBP
sharing	VBG
some	DT
common	JJ
interests	NNS
.	.

Hence	RB
,	,
another	DT
challenge	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO
mine	VB
such	JJ
social	JJ
interactions	NNS
from	IN
the	DT
raw	JJ
community	NN
data	NNS
.	.

While	IN
mining	NN
social	JJ
interactions	NNS
is	VBZ
not	RB
a	DT
new	JJ
topic	NN
,	,
a	DT
distinguishing	VBG
aspect	NN
of	IN
CIM	NNP
settings	NNS
is	VBZ
the	DT
abundance	NN
of	IN
temporal	JJ
data	NNS

CIM	NNP

allow	VB
us	PRP
to	TO
infer	VB
social	JJ
interactions	NNS
and	CC
their	PRP$

more	RBR

Once	RB
social	JJ

they	PRP
can	MD
be	VB
