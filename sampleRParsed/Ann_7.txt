not
positive.
i
emailed
mom
saying
make
sure
you
bring
stuff
to
occupy
yourself
with.
bc
it'll
be
like
3
hrs
of
names
being
read.
commencement
on
wednesday
is
a
bit
more
exciting.
or
at
least
pomp
and
circumstancey.
yeah
i
guess.
and
yeah.
i
can
help
you
with
that.
though
you
might
have
to
wait
til
after.
why?
1am?
1pm.
ok.
um.
i
mean
you
can
always
leave
whenever.
are
you
and
mom
staying
at
all
tomorrow?
or
i
just
see
you
for
class
day?
well
maybe.
maybe
not.
that's
with
hannah
right?
whens
mom
going
home?
ok.
but
yeah,
you
can
use
the
printer
in
my
dorm.
though
you'll
have
to
be
signed
in.
yes.
idk.
who
cares.
literally
like
1000
names
are
beingcalled.
so
it's
not
really
special.
like
an
special
occasion
that
someone's
name
is
being
called.
i
saw
some
of
the
SEAS
class
day
today
and
it
was
a
little
bullshitty.
though
idk,
maybe
CC
will
be
better
since
there
are
more
people.
and
i
didn't
see
the
whole
thing.
ok
gonna
go
now,
see
you
tomorrow.
what
logon?
ac3094
/
monkshouse1.
you'll
need
either
my
id
or
to
be
signed
in.
to
get
to
anywhere
with
a
computer
lab.
what
do
you
need
to
print?
why
don't
you
prnt
now?
can't
you
print
exxtra
copies?
whatever.
it
won't
be
hard
to
print
something
here.
just,
you'llhave
to
coordinate
with
me.
actually
no.
you
can
go
to
the
nypl.
on
broadway
between
113
and
114.
though
actually
you
need
an
nypl
card
to
use
the
lab.
but
i
have
one.
but
it
always
smells
insane
in
there.
lots
of
homeless
people.
so
i'd
say
just
use
the
lab
in
my
dorm.
mergh.
stupid
trayvon
martin
trial.
zimmerman
was
acquitted.
i'm
just
annoyed
at
people's
reactions.
lots
of
dumb
reactions.
the
verdict
is
good.
but
the
trial
is
a
fiasco.
not
surprising
that
he
was
acquitted.
but
what
pisses
me
off.
is
that
people
are
just
saying,
oh
yeah
it's
disappointing
but
not
surprising.
as
if
the
fact
that
it's
not
surprising
can
somehow
mitigate
your
outrage.
that
just
makes
it
worse.
facts
are:
trayvon
was
unarmed,
zimmerman
was
armed,
zimmerman
pursued
trayvon,
travyon
dies.
should
have
been
manslaughter.
but
it's
impossible
to
prove
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
does
it
work
well
though?
i
think
this
case
shows
that
it's
pretty
terribly
disappointing
system.
which
is
why
i'm
tired
of
people
just
being
like,
oh
not
a
surprise.
it's
not
a
trade-off.
we
just
couldn't
prove
that
it
wasn't
self-defense.
that's
just
really
hard
to
prove
since
the
only
person
who
witnessed
the
incident
who
is
still
alive
is
zimmerman.
zimmerman
killed
trayvon
and
he's
cleared
of
all
charges.
and
the
verdict
was
fair.
what
are
we
allowed
to
feel
about
this?
maybe
our
definition
of
self-defense
is
wrong.
zimmerman
picked
the
fight,
trayvon
might
have
gotten
the
upperhand,
zimmerman
kills
trayvon.
he
gets
to
say,
trayvon
was
beating
me,
so
i
killed
him.
what's
number
1?
zimmerman
picked
the
fight?
again,
idk
exactly
but
i
know
that
zimmerman
spotted
trayvon,
thought
he
looked
suspicious,
called
the
police,
police
said
don't
follow
him,
zimmerman
follows
him.
trayvon
dead.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
zimmerman
initiated
the
interaction.
but
the
details
of
exactly
what
happened
after
are
impossible
to
prove
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
?
i've
only
read
that
the
911
operator
said
stay
in
your
car.
yeah,
anyway,
i
don't
know
what's
wrong,
but
somethings
wrong
about
this
and
i'm
just
mostly
angry
that
people
are
so
indifferent.
like
it's
cool
to
be
jaded
about
something
like
this.
you're
dumb.
1.
evan's
over
the
top,
i
agree.
2.
just
because
the
verdict
is
correct
doesn't
mean
this
okay.
Some
reading:
a.
"The
most
damning
element
here
is
not
that
George
Zimmerman
was
found
innocent:
it’s
the
bitter
knowledge
that
Trayvon
Martin
was
found
guilty."

"Trials
like
this
one
can
never
fully
answer
the
larger
societal
questions
they
pose.
They

never
act
as
moral
surrogates
to

the
national

they

c.
The
law
in
Florida
is
fundamentally
flawed.
[WSJ]
"The
1962
Model
Penal
Code
of
the
American
Law
Institute,
upon
which
the
criminal
codes
of
three-quarters
of
the
states
are
based,
provides
an
elegant
solution
to
the
problem:
If
the
jury
concludes
that
the
defender
honestly
but
unreasonably
believed
he
had
to
kill
to
save
himself—i.e.,
a
reasonable
person
in
his
situation
would
not
have
made
the
same
mistake—then
he
is
liable
for
something
less
than
murder
but
gets
more
than
a
complete
acquittal.
His
liability
would
follow
a
sliding
scale
to
match
the
culpability
of
his
mistake:
A
negligent
mistake
gets
him
negligent
homicide;
a
reckless
mistake
gets
him
reckless
homicide
(manslaughter).
But
some
states,
including
Florida,
have
not
adopted
this
sliding-scale
approach
of
the
Model
Code
but
instead
use
an
all-or-nothing
formulation.
Either
the
defendant's
mistake
was
reasonable,
in
which
case
he
is
innocent
of
murder,
or
it
was
not,
in
which
case
he
is
liable
for
murder.
This
formulation
was
meant
to
be
tougher
on
people
who
kill
in
self-defense,
holding
them
to
a
high
standard
if
they
use
deadly
force.
But
in
practice
the
rule
commonly
has
the
opposite
effect.
Juries
are
loath
to
treat
as
a
murderer
a
person
who
made
mistakes,
even
culpable
mistakes,
during
the
chaos
of
self-defense.
So
presented
with
an
all-or-nothing
choice,
juries
can
end
up
giving
defendants
a
free
pass
when
they
actually
deserve
some
(perhaps
mitigated)
punishment.".
And
this
sums
it
all
up:
http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/on-the-killing-of-trayvon-martin-by-george-zimmerman/277773/.
Yeah
but
the
outcome
(not
the
trial)
is
still
an
indictment
of
race
relations.
When
are
we
allowed
to
have
a
convo
about
this?
When
are
we
allowed
to
get
angry?
Agree
that's
counterproductive
but
this
trial
verdict
should
still
provoke
outrage
at
the
situation
which
led
to
it.
And
that's
about
racism
profiling
and
guns.
And
also
anger
that
the
verdict
doesn't
and
could
not
ever
offer
justice
for
the
situation.
*trial
not
verdict.
What?
Men
or
women's.
I
have
work.
She
might.
Don't
you
have
school?
Ask
her
now.
Did
she
already
leave
Taiwan?
What
day
is
the
match?
