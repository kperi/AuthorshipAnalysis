anyways
good
luck
with
the
work
man
I'm
sure
it'll
get
better
Yah
sure
I'm
on
my
mobile
but
when
I'm
on
my
laptop
I
will
Any
preferences
on
type?
Ok
yah
sure
I'll
dig
some
stuff
up
for
you
yah,
hey
sorry
man.
Just
got
back
from
a
trip
to
Hangzhou
I
can
get
you
a
full
response
and
everything
in
the
morning
but
haha,
yah
great
article
on
Deep
Springs
and
such.
Hey
man
Sent
you
some
essays
for
your
referece.
reference.
Most
of
it
is
pretty
recent
because
that
is
all
I
have
on
my
laptop
right
now.
Let
me
know
if
you
need
older
stuff,
I
can
have
my
family
send
it
along.
good.
yah
yah
for
sure.
Remind
me
when
I
get
back
to
the
states
and
I'll
dig
those
up.
I
think
they
are
on
my
old
laptop.
also
on
that
quote
you
had,
very
very
interesting
proposition
that
I
probably
accept
more
than
I'm
comfortable
with.
hahaha,
ya
I
don't
really
post
much,
but
when
I
do,
its
usually
full
sentences
not
sure
how
I
feel
about
this
idea
of
a
sort
of
self
appointed
"elite"
and
uncomfortable
with
the
standards
that
are
used
to
determine
if
somebody
has
really
"heard
the
voice
of
the
desert"
but,
in
reality
I
basically
accept
something
similar
to
that
as
the
norm
and
actually
use
that
as
a
source
of
motivation
I
think
those
standards
are
all
self
determined
which
is
where
the
problem
lies
everybody
would
like
to
think
they
"have"
or
"could"
hear
the
voice.
so
it
lets
in
lots
of
riff
raff,
I
think
the
rigors
of
deep
springs
are
a
good
way
of
trying
to
get
kids
to
hear
it,
but
certainly
not
the
only
way.
hmm,
no
I
think
the
look
for
kids
open
to
hearing
the
voice.
I
think
if
you
are
really
already
in
tune
with
the
voice
and
your
own
leadership
then
you
don't
belong
there
like
you
already
have
what
the
education
is
supposed
to
give
you.
hmm,
well
I
sort
of
disagreed
with
the
approach
to
being
high
quality
thoughtful
leaders
of
the
world
like
the
lack
of
emphasis
on
quantitiative
skills
and
science
I
think
deprives
kids
of
the
skills
they
need
to
really
lead
in
the
modern
world.
also,
of
the
skills
I
really
needed
to
work
on
in
college
going
and
reading
in
the
desert
and
manual
labor
was
deeply
appealing,
but
something
I
was
already
familiar
with
with.
in
many
ways
learning
to
navigate
the
high
social
and
network
based
environment
at
princeton
was
the
skill
set
that
I
lacked
princeton
was
almost
more
of
a
stark
change
in
environments
for
me
if
that
makes
sense
still
though,
was
deeply
torn.
called
deep
springs
like
at
10
pm
of
the
day
the
decision
was
due.
yah,
and
princeton
is
different
than
I
expected
it
to
be
and
I'm
sure
deep
springs
would
have
been
the
same
there
are
also
some
more
sinister
sides
to
that
school
like
the
female
professors
routinly
have
affairs
with
students
and
the
brothels
nearby
are
frequented
during
breaks.
I
needed
to
leave
high
school
and
learn
how
to
interact
with
the
opposite
sex,
not
completely
isolate
myself
from
it.
lol,
its
funny,
but
was
a
real
concern
at
the
time.
I
had
almost
no
experience
dealing
with
girls,
I
basically
just
studied
all
of
high
school.
I
needed
to
learn
how
to
be
social
and
outgoing
and
deep
springs
would
push
me
deeper
into
myself.
yah,
lots
of
times.
it
turned
down
lots
of
other
schools
and
have
never
once
regretted
going
to
princeton
over
those.
but,
princeton,
especially
in
my
engineering
classes
can
feel
so
impersonal
and
thoughtless
its
at
moments
like
that
when
I
really
question
whether
I
made
the
right
choice.
its
kind
of
the
same
question
as
to
whether
or
not
I
should
actually
be
an
engineer
eh,
Idk.
If
I
am
at
Princeton
I
would
be
orf.
originally
thought
about
going
in
as
woody
woo
instead.
but
now
I
think
that
is
a
pretty
bullshit
degree.
idk,
orf
is
rewarding
in
its
own
ways
wish
the
department
were
better
and
the
professors
cared
more.
but
I
do
think
I'm
getting
a
sort
of
technical
"liberal
arts"
education.
eh,
its
professors
are
super
hit
or
miss
ahaha
yah
that
is
the
case
certainly.
but
the
material
world
needs
guidance
and
needs
people
who
can
look
beyond
it.
like
his
example
of
Theodore
Roosevelt
doesn't
ring
the
most
true
to
me.
because
if
anybody
was
good
an
traversing
and
manipuating
the
material
world
it
was
him.
but
he
was
also
able
to
look
beyond
it.
and
I
don't
totally
buy
into
Nunn's
premise
that
complete
abstinence
from
things
like
women
and
alc
represent
a
transcendent
mind
I
would
actually
be
weary
of
a
leader
who
existed
completely
outside
of
that
sphere,
because
how
can
you
prompt
people
to
change
if
you
don't
at
least
somewhat
understand
their
motivation
to
act
as
they
do.
yah,
exactly.
that
sort
of
stuff
is
supposed
to
be
tempered,
also
I
don'
know
how
fundamentally
the
deep
spring
boys
bought
into
that
either
like
they
sounded
like
they
went
crazy
on
breaks.
drugs,
women,
prostitutes,
the
works.
yah,
its
a
little
more
real
that
I
had
had
in
my
mind
and
certainly
has
its
own
issues
once
you
get
there.
but
I
do
believe
there
is
some
real
value
in
stepping
away
from
all
of
that
for
me
that
is
what
india
was
supposed
to
be.
I
think
it
did
a
decent
job
of
that
actually
and
taught
me
to
be
culturally
and
socially
sensitive
in
a
way
I
was
not
before.
yah,
he
hits
lots
of
it
on
the
head.
like
if
we
could
actually
put
our
elite
through
a
program
like
this
then
I
think
the
world
would
undeniably
be
more
thoughtful
and
empathetic.
the
other
thing
I
struggled
with
was
that
I
didn't
see
lots
of
the
deep
springs
kids
coming
out
and
going
into
real
positions
to
make
a
change
a
few
were
in
reasonably
powerful
positions
of
government,
but
the
majority
sort
of
just
continued
a
life
of
quiet
thoughtful
learning,
which
is
great.
but
I
wanted
an
education
that
would
prepare
me
to
be
a
leader
and
a
director
of
the
fortunes
of
men.
yah,
but
especially
at
a
place
like
deep
springs
the
student
body
determines
your
learing.
learning
yah,
yes
actually
with
confidence
I
didn't
have
much
a
view
beyond
college
wanted
to
become
an
erudite
and
technically
skilled
leader
princeton
has
done
lots
to
fill
in
what
that
might
look
like
concretely
and
the
way
deep
springs
would
have
filled
that
in
would
have
been
different.
hmmm
does
it?
I
kind
of
thing
that
one
needs
to
put
time
in
the
trenches
so
that
later
you
can
assume
those
leadership
roles
I'm
really
not
sure
I
think
work
for
a
few
years
then
law
school.
I
would
like
to
live
and
work
abroad
for
a
while
as
well.
but
how
that
actually
translates
into
something
in
20
years
I
don't
know
I'm
pretty
undecided
what
route
would
make
me
happy
like
head
down
at
one
company
and
trying
to
work
my
way
to
the
top
of
something
large
and
powerful
doing
my
own
thing
and
trying
the
sort
of
disruptive
innovations
of
new
companies
government
even?
I'm
really
not
certain.
what
about
you?
