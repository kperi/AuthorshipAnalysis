Wow,

because
no
one
except
Alex
and
I
got
our
gifts
on
time,
everyone
is
quitting
under
the
semblance
of
"Secret
Santa
is
ruined".
Ed,
if
you
haven't
gotten
your
gift
yet,
it's
ok!
There's
still
time!
yeah

is
sarah
trying
to
cover
up
the
fact
that
she
let
the
secret
go:

Naughty
List:

Ed's
naughty
list:

FINALLY
KNOW
EVERYONE'S
SECRET
SANTA.

does
that
even
mea.
n.
Yo
for
real
though
we
should
figure
out
logistics.
Is
everyone
good
to
meet
in
the
Wilf
room
after
dinner
on
Thursday?
Or
maybe
get
dinner
together.
I'm
hesitant
to
meet
in
the
study
due
to
other
study
inhabitants
that
are
not
in
this.
ok
just
drop
off
your
present
in
Wilf302
at
some
point
during
Thursday
and
we'll
rendezvous
there
around
8-9.
wait
ed
has
cbe
until
10
damn.
dinner
is
not
going
to
work.
exchange
at
time
that
we
originally
planned,
meaning
9ish.
by
9:30,
please
have
your
presents
in
Wilf
302.
and
be
there.
<3.
happy
secret
santa-ing.
