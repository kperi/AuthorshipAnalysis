haahha
what.
whats
the
meaning.
i
have
no
clue.
actually
i
think
youre
right.
sounds
familiar.
oh
that
reminds
me.
i
wanted
to
ask
what
daway
meant.
im
bracing
myself.
hahaha
oh
ok
that
beats
my
guess
that
it
was
"big
question"
phewph.
no
i
already
asked
you
my
question,
it
was
about
if
you
had
any
family
members
who
knew
about
medical
universities
or
hospitals
in
china
lol.
yeah
ni
shi
wo
de
gong
ju.
<3.
dude
no
we
can
totally
party
it
up
if
you
come
with
me.
oh
wait
send
me
that
bike
tirp
link
thing.
yeah
that
would
be
prettty
cool.
I
know
the
story
was
so
pointless.
Uh
I
would
be
interested
in
basically
anhthjng
that
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
work
in
a
hospital
or
clinic
or
something,
like
even
helping
with
medical
research
idk.
I'm
not
like
too
sure
what
actual
work
ppl
normally
do
as
just
interns
but
I'll
look
into
it
and
get
back
to
you
soon.
Anything.
I
think
I
can
apply
for
princeton
funding
for
housing
and
travel.
Obv
paid
would
be
amazing
but
even
just
getting
any
kind
of
internship
would
be
great.
Like
if
there's
anhthjng
they
need
people
for
or
looking
for
help
idk.
I've
had
class
so
I
haven't
had
time
to
look
at
health
internship
responsibilities
yet
but
I'll
let
u
know
soon.
i
think
what
i'm
mainly
looking
for
is
the
opportunity
to
work
at
a
medical
university
doing
medical
research
mainly,
with
side
opportunities
to
shadow
clinicians
and
physicians
at
a
hospital
affiliated
with
the
university.
no
im
going
to
dillon,
but
im
worried
about
parking.
where
do
you
usually
park.
there
are
lots

dillon?
