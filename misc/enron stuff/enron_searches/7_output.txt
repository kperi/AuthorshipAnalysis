The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.

The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.

George does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily routine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on potential measurement issues on any NNG station, north or south.    If we need to follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the Tech.   It would be good if George would give us updates on physical/software repairs.   Angela has set him up to get into the NNG Measurement Log and he could make his own NNG entries & updates early in the morning before Jodie arrives at 7 AM..   That is up to him.  He can actually get in the log anytime he wants by letting Jodie know he wants to make entries.   I was told that George would be retiring the end of the year.  Once George retires then we will start doing the notifications on the NNG EFM custody transfer collection issues.  But in the mean time we need some help to make this NNG EFM effort work.

 Kermit Turbine station and KB-line outage has been scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 11th. We are planning for a 24 hour outage and it will be posted as a 24 hour shut-in, but if everything goes as planned operations could possibly be ready to go back in-service after 12 to 14 hours. The 30" KB-line mainline block valve 7 miles north of Kermit will be shut and line blown down. This will not affect the El Paso Keystone interconnect.  Based on current flows in the Kermit to Gomez subsystem  it would affect about 375,000 MMBTU.in deliveries and 25,000 mmbtu in receipts ( Sid Richardson)

I understand from Tracy Ngo that as a result of some organizational changes in RAROC there might be some personnel movement in your group.  As indicated in the e-mail below, our Portland Middle Market Group would like to see more resources dedicated to the credit function.  As a result of a number of factors credit is being asked to review a very large number of new counterparties and transactions for the Middle Market Group and it is typically taking 2 - 7 days to get a credit review turned around.  As you know, we believe existing personnel is top notch   There just aren't enough of them.  And, amongst all the RAC groups with whom we work, market risk and credit risk, it seems like resources are more constrained in the credit area.  We would love to see that reduced and anything you could do to make this happen would be appreciated.

"So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply," Valentine wrote in his most recent "Trucking Snapshot" for early March. 
Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over year, according to Valentine's index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was "masked by the strong economy," Valentine says. 
In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts.

Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62.

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

We are in the process of integrating 7 Enron Metals Far East Ltd employees from their former payroll to the Enron Japan payroll.  As part of this process, we are requiring them to sign the attached standard Confidentiality Agreement.  I'm getting a lot of pushback re: non-solicitation, and the fact that it governs all terminations (including involuntary).  Is there any possibility of amending?  Jane McBride and I have reviewed, and while we haven't yet sought advice on the matter, feel it would likely not be enforceable in Japan in case of involuntary termination without cause.  
Are we able to make the proposed change (redlined in purple in the attachment - I guess a lot of changes have been made to this document before either Jane or I were involved)?  As well, would it be an issue to insert something about jurisdiction?

A lot of shops are interested,  mainly speculators.       I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.      Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure,  locking in a fixed return.   How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc.
No problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up.

-------------------------

Please see the attached.    Remember that we are planning on buying hour ending 7 (50 mw's).    So,   we wont actually generate 250's as the schedule indicates.
Alex will take care of this tonight.

So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.

While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air.

1.  Why did Enron sell its stake in EOTT?
Enron decided in September of 2001 to monetize its ownership in EOTT (other than its 2% general partner ownership) which consisted of 3.3 million common units, 7 million subordinated units and $9.3 million additional partnership units. The monetization was recognized as a sale for book purposes and a financing for tax purposes.  Enron retained voting and dispositive power with respect to these interest.  Enron, being deemed a control person, filed the appropriate SEC documents with repect to this transaction.

I have been assisting Ron Bertrand in reviewing the proposed Confidentiality Agreement between Enron and AEGIS.  The original proposal was for a confidentiality agreement running to the benefit of AEGIS.  A subsequent comment from Sara Shackelton, however indicates that a two-way agreement is necessary.  As such there are several issues clauses that must be included to address issues unique to underwriting insurance.  Specifically (a) confidential information supplied in order to induce AEGIS to underwrite an insurance policy must be warranted (as in any insurance application), (b) AEGIS needs the right to share such information with reinsurers (who can be held to a confidentiality agreement), and (c) if a policy is purchased AEGIS need to retain the information in case there are any enforcement disputes that might turn on the application information.  The AEGIS standard confidentiality agreement used in underwriting situations is attached.
With regard to the revised draft of June 22nd. I note, in addition to the issues mentioned above, that the governing law provision is somewhat contradictory to the arbitration provisions and that the assumption in section 7 that confidentiality provisions will be incorporated in to the definitive agreement is usually not true for insurance policies.
Please feel free to contact me directly (201-521-4691) to conclude this matter.

Just keep your eyes open for the return tag that they will send you in the mail for the 7 yards.  Ah -  the trials and tribulations of home decorating!

On Friday, August 10 at 11:00 am, the teams will meet to begin construction and they have 45 minutes to complete their model of Enron's attributes.  At 12:00 pm, Ken Lay will host the judging competition with the winner decided using "The Applause Meter."
Each team must consist of 7 to 10 members from their business unit and must have at least 3 executives (i.e., Directors or above).  The model must be freestanding.  And, although Legos will be provided as the primary building tool, other materials may be used, so use your imagination.
Please call or e-mail Julie Clyatt if you are interested in participating.  She can be reached at ext. 3-3256.

The original $32mm of swaps DID NOT provide a clean hedge to the remaining El Paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the El Paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer.
However, the $382mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged.

I offered Don Headley a split earlier when I was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. Charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which I explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. Discussions would have had to be held "in camera"  and 2. Others would have to be negatively impacted.  Neither of these criteria were met. I was simply being a good  capitalist.

Our Copel shares are falling in value.  We have never marked this investment even though it is public.  We currently own ADR's - ELP is the ticker.  We are restricted (i think) in selling until July.  At the current price we would lose 15 to 30 Million.  
Copel is trading at $6.70, down over $1.00 from Thursday close. The rumor is that this is the aftershock of a 7 MM block trade last week.

The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.

       Thanks for checking in.  We are doing fine.  In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.  I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so.

Forecast:  The forecast through June is likely to bring at least 3 and as many as 6 more days with minimum temperatures below 50.

The real issue with Local 15 is when Midwest purchased ComEd, they assumed all ComEd agreements with the labor union.  However, the labor union feels Midwest has not complied with this agreement and at this point Local 15 is using the threat of a strike to get Midwest's attention.  
IBEW sanctioned a strike last Friday and took this action as a sign of support for the Local 15.  The IBEW support gives the Local 15 bargaining power in their discussions with Midwest.  The hope is that the possibility of a strike will put enough pressure on Midwest to get them to the negotiation table.  Chicago's Local 15 union is a compilation of 7 local unions.
Since Midwest took ownership of the plants, there has been 45 cases brought before the grievance committee and all 45 cases have been referred to arbitration. These cases were filed due to the labor unions perception of Midwest not following the original labor contract.  Currently, the labor union lacks the funds for this costly procedure.  Prior to Midwest, ComEd and the labor unions were able to work out grievances.

I just answer questions and give details and just talk to people about details.  I am loving IT!! and not overwhelmed. My big decision will be what dress to wear.  Larry is right back into working HARD on these sprint deals after our ski trip.  The kids are asking to go again - even Kyle after altitude sickness- they both want to be in breckenridge!! Larry talked to a friend that has a condo in i think winter park. said we could use it sometime.  any other news:  Kyle was star student last week - made a huge poster with tons of pictures to share with his class.  Amazing to me that he is almost 7 years old.  The art teacher told me that after class last monday he just spontaneously gave her the biggest hug  and it made her day.  He is one special little boy.

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Cleaning pigs are being run in Section 7 & 8 as gas flows allow.  Cleaning pigs will be ran in Section 5 during the week of Aug. 20th.  


-------------------------
enronsent33: 45657


During the week of Sept. 10th there will be a TD Williamson representative on site to determine if Sections 7 & 8 are clean enough to smart pig.  Teams Roswell, Mountainair and Laguna will need to run the cleaning pigs until acceptably clean.  The smart pig runs in Section 7 & 8 is scheduled for the week of Sept. 17th.  I will send another e-mail dealing with the smart pig.

Sta. 7 (Mountainair)
From Mountainair, NM - Head South on Hwy. 55 for 11.7 miles.  Hwy. 55 turns left (East) at this point and County Road goes straight.  Take the county road which is gravel and follow main gravel road for 10.8 miles to Compressor Station.

In preparation for smart pigging the mainline in sections 7 & 8 in September, TDW caliper tool runs were performed last week.  We also ran the caliper tools in both lines of section 5 this week to pinpoint dents indicated last year by TDW.  They were unable to get valid data from their equipment last year and performed this weeks run at no cost.


-------------------------
enronsent33: 46431

August 21st
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 7 to Sta. 6 - No indications of dents or ovalities greater than 1.5" (5% of pipe diameter). 


-------------------------
enronsent33: 46433

August 22nd
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 8 to Sta. 7 - Three indications of dents above 1.5" - 1.71", 1.75" & 2.45".   According to PII the 2.45" dent should still leave approximately .5" clearance for the smart tool to pass.  All indications above 1.5" will need to be repaired per our procedures.  This will probably be done when making repairs resulting form the smart pig run.  This is preliminary field data and could change with further evaluation by TDW.  The full report will be complete in two to four weeks.  The TDW representative did say that any changes would be to a smaller number.


-------------------------
enronsent33: 46442


The smart pig runs in section 7 & 8 are on schedule and will be performed the week of September 17th.  The Sta. 8 to Sta. 7 smart pig will be run on Tuesday and the Sta. 7 to Sta. 6 smart pig will be run on Thursday.

Darrell,
At Gallup last year it took about 250 mmcfd to run the pig 6 miles per hour.  If my memory is bad someone let me know.  If we can move that amount with 7 & 9 easily then there should be no problem.
Thanks,  Arnie

On Tuesday we ran a PII smart pig in section 8 (Station 8 to Station 7) and on Thursday ran the smart pig in section 7 (Station 7 to Station 6).  Both runs appear to be successful.  The data will be forwarded to PII in Houston and a preliminary report will be ready in 2 to 3 weeks.  The final report will take 3 months.  
I would like to thank The teams from Montainair, Roswell and Laguna, the support help from teams Panhandle and Flagstaff, the Albuquerque Corrosion Specialist, and the Roswell Construction & Engineering group for their dedicated efforts to see the project completed.  Long days and short nights don't seem as bad when you've performed well and accomplished the goal.

What the future holds? - I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit Emily and then she comes back to Houston for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that.  And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts.  September is also an option if that works better for you.  I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends.  Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase.

Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)
Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month's estimated IFC charges for all EES' customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES' customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.

I received CERS/CDWR's last of the 7 day settlements payments on Friday - on time.  
Let me know if there is anything else I can do.  Otherwise, I will return to settling "normally" with them.

In order to continue settlements on a weekly basis - I feel we are going to have to have that in writing - them agreeing to it; because just today someone from CERS called to confirm that we got our last payment from them and to say "goodbye & thanks" since I would no longer be calling her with 7 day settlements since that ends March 31st.  So #1 I need to know that we have relayed it to the correct people there before I forecast money coming in again weekly.  Also, I need to see what all deals should be included - because in March there was both a buy & sale that was checkedout with CDWR and paid according to WSPP.  We had the 7 day settlements deal under CDWR when it probably should have been under CERS - since that is who was on the confirm for the 7 day settlement.

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including.  They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a "peoples choice" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).

The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.

We are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning (10 mws at $99.00) in the flash we received yesterday.  Remember, the awarded congestion wheel caused the 10 mw variance we discussed on Monday.

We relieved Path 15 congestion for HE 7 on Saturday morning.  We flowed 10 mws from Malin to FC345. This resulted in the 10 mw "variance" in the report. I have added deals to Enpower to flatten the report, these deals are only necessary for the sake of the report. The identical variance in the north and south indicates a wheel or load shift. I prefer to not enter these extra deals. Please see me with questions if you do not understand why the report variance exists.

I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.
