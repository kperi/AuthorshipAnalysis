RonCD3 contains a subset of the Enron corpus provided by Ron Bekkerman at:
http://www.cs.umass.edu/~ronb/enron_dataset.html

These messages have been annotated with topics. The messages are  
stored in the same directory structure as used in the Ron Bekkerman 
version of the data (which is based on user).

The annotation of the RonCD3 data was done with the Coder 
(http://www.wagsoft.com/Coder). 

The directory main contains the annotated messages found in RonCD3, but  
organized by topic rather than user. There are approximately 3000 
annotated messages as of version 0.03. The directory main-noheader 
contains those same messages, but without email headers. 

The RonCD3 directory was converted to the topic oriented directory 
hierarchy using the Cd3topics.pl programs found in Coder2Sval, available 
at http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/enron.html.
