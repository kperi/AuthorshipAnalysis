
Issue is headcount approval. In the next 6 months I&apos;m not sure we can commit to any increase, although if we get a flying start in Canada it is possible. While I think we can explore whether UBS are interested elsewhere, my feeling is that we can&apos;t commit to anything at this stage. If things are different in July them maybe we can reconsider if they haven&apos;t found something elsewhere.
