That being the case, Tom, Barry, Brian and I agree that we should extend an offer to Morris Larubbio.  If Gary and Morris accept, that will complete the 2 marketing slots for Texas.

Louise, with mark smith out, I&apos;d like approval to go to plan B which would be to extend an offer to Gary Brian. How do we go about doing this?
