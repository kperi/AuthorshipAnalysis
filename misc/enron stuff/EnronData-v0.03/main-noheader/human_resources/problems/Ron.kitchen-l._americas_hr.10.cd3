
Louise,

Carlos has informed me that he has been told he will likely be laid off. 


- If the new purchaser is interested in the TexMex concept, Carlos is the most important Mexican link. He has great relationships, has negotiated MOU&apos;s and is close to contract with multiple customers.

- If we desire to retain EnronOnline expertise, Carlos has it.

- He is still on the US payroll and has an Enron working visa.
