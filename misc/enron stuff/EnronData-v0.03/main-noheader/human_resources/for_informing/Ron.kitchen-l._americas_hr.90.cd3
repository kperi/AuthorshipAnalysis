
Louise, EGM may be interested in extending a job offer to Gil to work in the weather group.  I had a discussion with Mike McConnell and gave him my general opinion.  I may have oversold.  I will keep you posted.
In addition, Jared Kaiser is returning from EGM and will take over the lead Origination role in the Southeast as we have discussed.
