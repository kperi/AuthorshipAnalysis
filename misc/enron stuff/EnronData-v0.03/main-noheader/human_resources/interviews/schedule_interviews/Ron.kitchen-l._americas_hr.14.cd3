
All,
 
 
Below are the confirmed list of names to be interviewed for the Origination Track, Wednesday, 28th November.     (there are a possibility of a further 3 candidates).
 
All of you are confirmed to interview, however I require another 4/5 interviewers (Manager/director level) to ensure all candidates are interviewed by 5 originators.   Pls advise who from your groups can facilitate interviewing.
 
Interview schedules/resumes will be sent to you early next week.
 
I look forward to hearing from you. 
 
Regards,
 

Human Resources
