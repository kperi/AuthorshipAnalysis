Dear Celeste and Stinson,

I am writing to refuse Enron&apos;s offer for a summer position.  After several
conversations with my advisor at Stanford, we have decided that I should
remain at Stanford to work on my dissertation.

Thank you again for taking the time to show me around Enron.

Sincerely,
