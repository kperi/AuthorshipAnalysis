You will gain a better understanding of the laws and regulations that define your individual and organizational accountability. This training will address the complex realms of employment opportunity, unlawful harassment, discrimination, retaliation, as well as aspects of selection, promotion and performance management and corrective discipline.  In addition, this training will discuss roles in managing risk - keys to supervisory success - some basic information on privacy obligations and some discussion of key HR policies.
