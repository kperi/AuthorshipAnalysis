Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our &quot;contribution loss&quot; (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&amp;CC and HPL).
