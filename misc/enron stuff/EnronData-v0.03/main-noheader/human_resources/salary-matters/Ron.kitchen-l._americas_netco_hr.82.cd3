I spoke with Dave last night and he would like to propose the following changes.

Stephanie Sever		from $6,500	to $7,000	
Christopher Walker	from $2,000	to $4,000	(Jennifer Denny highly recommends, contributions not reflected in mid-year rating)
Fraisy George		from $2,479	to $3,000	(used to be in call center, nature of job changed and has increased responsibility from mid-year)
Adam Johnson 		from $2,000	to $6,000	(Jennifer Denny highly recommends, would take him over anyone else at his level, feels should be compensated for 							his contributions)

Please let me know your thoughts.
