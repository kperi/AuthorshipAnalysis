
Richard, do you have any need for a paralegal?  This person is on 
redeployment from CALME and is interested in even short-term assignments, if 
any are out there.  She is a former paralegal from V&amp;E, but has been working 
here for a while.

Let me know.

Michelle,

Peggy would be a great addition to your team if you have a spot, permanent or 
short-term.  Let me know what you think!
