
A friend of mine that I&apos;ve known since college at Harding is looking for a
job in IT or consulting.

His last stint was as a Senior Systems Engineer in Compaq&apos;s SAP Solutions
Center.

He&apos;s a stellar guy, and very smart, as you can tell from his resume.

If you know of any opportunities, please pass this along.

Thanks,
