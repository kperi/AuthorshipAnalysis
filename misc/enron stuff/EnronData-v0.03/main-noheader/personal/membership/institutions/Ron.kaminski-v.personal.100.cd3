The phone has been found and has not been  compromised in any way.

Can you, please, restore the service.

Thanks.

&gt; Vince Kaminski left his cell phone on the bus last Friday.  He has
&gt; contacted
&gt; the Bus line, but the person in charge of the Lost and Found is not in the
&gt; office today.
&gt;
&gt; If there any way that we can put a hold on this telephone until he can see
&gt; whether it has been turned in or not?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Please let me know as soon as possible.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
