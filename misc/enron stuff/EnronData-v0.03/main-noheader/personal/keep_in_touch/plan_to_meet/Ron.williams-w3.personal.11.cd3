
I completely forgot about your trip to Vegas. I bet you didn&apos;t! Ha ha. Anyhow, I&apos;m bummed that you are going to gone thursday and we won&apos;t be able to hang out at the Happy Hour. You&apos;ll be having a blast in Vegas though, so no biggie. Anyhow, I guess I&apos;ll see you tomorrow. Maybe we can go get a beer after work tomorrow night if you don&apos;t leave too early. If not, there will be much beer to drink when you get back into town next week.
