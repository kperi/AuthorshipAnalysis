
Vince,
It was a pleasure to meet you last week at our Rodeo night.  I am glad you
could join us.

I am going to fax you the invitation to the Houston Symphony Partners party
that we discussed.  I hope you can attend.

Keep in touch and let&apos;s get together for lunch and/or seeing &quot;American
Beauty.&quot;
