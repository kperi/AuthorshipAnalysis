
Hello all!

As you are aware, Houston is asking all Enron employees to be involved in their United Way Campaign. While you are encouraged to take part, please keep in mind that we will be doing a Portland United Way Campaign to benefit our local community.  More information will be available in the next month or so.


If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Grace
