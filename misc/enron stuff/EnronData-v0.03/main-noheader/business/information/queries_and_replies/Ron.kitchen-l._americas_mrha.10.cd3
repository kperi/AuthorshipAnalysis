
Louise,

I am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of Pluto/MEGS to Duke Energy Field Services as well as the sale of the Napoleonville Land to Texas Brine.  In addition, I am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in Dow Wells 13 &amp; 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from Dow.

Are there any types of transactions that would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to close?  For example, if we do an outsourcing deal for three years, how do we know that Dynegy will honor the contract?
