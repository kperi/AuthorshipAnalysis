
Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don&apos;t change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP&apos;s concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.
