Yes, and as a matter of fact...I&apos;d called the Benefits Help Line recently and 
they&apos;d said &quot;No Coverage&quot; on Dental.  I think I am all set.  If you find out 
otherwise, let me know!  Thanks. 







Please confirm that you changed your Dental election to No Coverage.  I 
recall a phone conversation, however, need definite clarification.

Thank you,
