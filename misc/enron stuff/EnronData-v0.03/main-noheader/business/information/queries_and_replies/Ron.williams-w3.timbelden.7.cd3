Dynegy Introduces Hourly Power Products to Dynegydirect; Real-Time Market Information Provides Customers With Greater Control and Efficiency
Along with the energy and emission allowance product offerings, Dynegydirect now offers hourly power products backed by Dynegy&apos;s diversified commercial asset base. Hourly power markets for on-peak hours will initially be available at major interconnects in the Midwest. As Dynegy&apos;s generation portfolio expands throughout the country, additional North American hourly products and locations will be added to Dynegydirect.
&quot;Posting our products and services online through Dynegydirect enables our customers to execute in real-time,&quot; said Matt Schatzman, president of Energy Trading for Dynegy Inc. &quot;This is especially important in the hourly market where trading decisions are analyzed each hour in a ten to 20 minute window.&quot;
