Can you do me a favor when you have a minute,  I am doing a will and need details of my stocks and options and I wanted to check out that I have everything included as I do not information on all of it (particularly a recent tranche).  Can you email me a spreadsheet (usual password) or if that is too much of a problem just the nominal values of vested and unvested at current Enron stock prices.

Thanks
