
I&apos;m not familiar with the individual assets (might include gaspart and ceg/rio) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $690mm loan to enron. When enron hit bbb- rating, rawhide was no longer allowed to lend to enron and called the note due. There was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider enron&apos;s request to delay the call by several weeks. Neither bowen nor myself know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time.
