
Louise,

First - congratulations on the new baby!  Life has just changed big time in case you haven&apos;t already noticed (I have 3 daughters myself).  Best wishes on your new addition.

Second - I wanted to test your interest on being the exec lead for Carnegie-Mellon Associate Recruiting this fall.  I&apos;ve been assuming (maybe incorrectly) that with your new responsibilities (home and work) that you might pass on it this year - but I want that to be your decision.  If you want to do it, we certainly would appreciate your help.  If you can&apos;t do it, I&apos;d appreciate any recommendation you might have for a replacement.  I&apos;d prefer a senior level (VP or above) alum, if possible.  I&apos;ll find someone if no names come to mind immediately.

Take care and I hope all is well,
