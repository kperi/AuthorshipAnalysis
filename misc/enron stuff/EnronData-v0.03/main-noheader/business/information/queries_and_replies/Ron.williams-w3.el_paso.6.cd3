Hi Bill,

When you get a chance can you correct this day?

HE 15 sale to CISO/Powerx should be a 0 MWH (Cut at top of hour)

Also,  do you know what the 25 MWH FC/PV swap deal  with AEP/APS is.  We
don&apos;t show this in our EMS.  Could it be one of Enron&apos;s deals and on the
model
by mistake??  Prices are $350.00 and $520.00???

Thanks,
