
Louise,

I believe that if we want the Broker Client Contracts to be a source of $$ then we will need to wait and negotiate new contracts in several months after we reestablish a dominant position.

If we want the Brokers to help us build liquidity immediately, we should give them the contracts for free - and pay them brokerage.

Your thoughts?
