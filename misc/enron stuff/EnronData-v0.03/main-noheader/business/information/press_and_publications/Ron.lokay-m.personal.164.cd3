NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - E-Trade Group Inc. (ET), the No. 2 U.S. Internet brokerage, on Wednesday said it had agreed to put 20 E-Trade shops and more than 1,000 bank machines into Target Corp. (TGT) stores nationwide. 
E-Trade will be the exclusive automated teller machine network for all Target and Target Greatland stores in the United States. E-Trade currently has ATMs in 110 Target stores. 
The E-Trade shops -- &quot;E-Trade Zones&quot; -- are 400-square-foot facilities within SuperTarget stores staffed with sales and service representatives where customers can open a brokerage account. E-Trade and Target launched a pilot program for the stores in September with an E-Trade Zone in Roswell, Ga.
