

I&apos;m looking forward to getting your outline on the economic paradigm. I hope 
that, among all the paper I&apos;ve bombarded you with over the last few weeks, I 
have included a reprint of a FAll 1998 JACF article entitled &quot;How to use EVA 
in the oil and gas industry.&quot; If this is not among the things I have left you 
with, I&apos;d be happy to send you a copy.

The discussion of hydrocarbon reserve values is very much along the lines we 
have been discussing.
