Valarie,

Thanks again for the emails you sent to us on 9/1/00 and 9/4/00 regarding the 
killed deals for the City of Vernon.  The reports you provided were exactly 
what we needed in order to explain the large cash flow change received from 
the West book.    Please continue to send these types of reports in the 
future.
