
I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.   David worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions.
