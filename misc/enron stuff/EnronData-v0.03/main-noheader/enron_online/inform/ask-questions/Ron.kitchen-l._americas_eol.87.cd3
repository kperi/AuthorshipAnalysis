
Per Mark Palmer&apos;s instruction, I am forwarding this report issued by Dr. Phil Verleger on Monday, October 29 regarding EnronOnline.  Verleger is often used a source by the New York Times, so we would like to refute his claims.  Do we have someone who can analyze his claims and create a point-counterpoint document to his comments about EnronOnline?  Please advise.
