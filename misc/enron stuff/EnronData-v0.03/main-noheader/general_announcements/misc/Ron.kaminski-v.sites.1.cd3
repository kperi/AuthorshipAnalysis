
Hello--Listen, wanted to make sure you received a copy of our newest publication last week, The Risk Desk. Because of the size of the files we sent out, quite a few bounced back because some corp firewalls halt emails over a certain size. Anyhow, if you didn&apos;t receive the issue, hit the reply button and type &quot;resend Risk Desk.&quot; Responce so far has been great for those of you that received the free copy -- we think you&apos;ll agree that it&apos;s soon to become the leading &quot;must read&quot; publication on market, credit, price and operational risk management in the energy space. 
Also, just a reminder, the charter price for a one year subscription ($199) ends soon. Let us know.
