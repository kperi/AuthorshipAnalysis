
You asked; we answered.  Many of you shared your ideas with us about what you 
think will make the New Peoplefinder a better information resource.  You 
suggested that we add aliases (AKAs) and fax, pager, and cell numbers.  We 
did.  Keep sending us your good ideas, click &quot;Contact us&quot; on peoplefinder.

Thanks for your support.
