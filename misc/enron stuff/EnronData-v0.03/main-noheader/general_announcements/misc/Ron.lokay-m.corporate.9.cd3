
We want to hear from you!  The eThink Team is asking each Enron employee to 
submit one &quot;Dream eSpeaker&quot; suggestion for consideration to host an eSpeak 
session.

Is there someone outside of Enron that you feel would have a valid audience 
inside Enron?  Or, is there someone at Enron you think we have overlooked 
thus far?
