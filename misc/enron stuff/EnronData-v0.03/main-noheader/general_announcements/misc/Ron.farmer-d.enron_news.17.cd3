Beginning today, you can access a videotaped message from me about our second quarter results and our new strategy concerning Enron Broadband Services.  As you listen, I hope you find the information valuable and this new way of communicating easy and timely.  I plan to do this regularly, so watch your e-mail for future messages.  Thanks for listening and have a great day.
