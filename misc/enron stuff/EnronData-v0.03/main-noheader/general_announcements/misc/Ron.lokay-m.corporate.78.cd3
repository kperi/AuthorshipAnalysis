
Good morning, hope everyone had a great weekend!!!  Now let&apos;s get back to 
helping millions.  Don&apos;t forget to fill out your online pledge card before 
the &quot;Sundae Wednesday.&quot;  And remember, we will be having &quot;Million dollar 
Sundaes&quot; on Wednesday in front of the copy machine where the celebrations are 
usually held.

If you need assistance with your online pledge card please feel free to give 
me a call at ext. 3-7571.

Thanks,
