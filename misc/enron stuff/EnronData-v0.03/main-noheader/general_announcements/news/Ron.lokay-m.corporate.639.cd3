
Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron&apos;s Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, &quot;I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.&quot;
