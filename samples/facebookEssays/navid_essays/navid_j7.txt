Out of these years of mediocre film making, Project X, directed by Nima Nourizadeh, takes the cake for stupidest, most ludicrous movie.
	Project X follows the antics of three friends who throw a party to increase their popularity. After inviting kids from throughout the school, and using Craigslist and the radio to invite even more people, there seems to be hundreds of partygoers crowding the main character, Thomas’s, home. From stealing the ecstasy-filled garden gnome of a local drug dealer, to a vengeful dwarf driving Thomas’s parent’s Mercedes into the pool out of angst for being put in the oven earlier in the day, to the drug dealer trying to get back his gnome and by doing this ends up setting the house and the neighborhood on fire, Project X is filled with ridiculous plot points meant to do nothing more than to shock the viewers. Such a movie embodies all that is wrong in the cinema. The repetition of women in promiscuous sexual scenes and the absurd story line add up to a gimmicky movie that tries to make the audience feel like they are in a wild party. Such gimmicks, however, are by definition very useful for entrancing the masses, and so this movie did very well in the box office, especially bolstered by the audience of high school boys who are obsessed with the thought of an out of control party like the one depicted in Project X.
	Project X is a truly a sad point in cinema and no one of a sober mindset should have any respect for such an abomination of a movie.
