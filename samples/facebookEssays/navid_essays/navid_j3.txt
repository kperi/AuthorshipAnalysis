
      These six pages of “Trust, Civic Engagement, and the Internet” demonstrate all the necessary elements of an argument of inquiry. Uslaner describes his motives for inquiry on the controversial issue of if the Internet added or took away social capital from the world and continues to describe how the resolution of this issue holds importance to present users and possible future users of the Web, and to the policy makers who will make policies directly affected the answer to this inquiry. The academic discourse community that will be reading this article directly will likely be members of the academia who have interest in this subject. Uslaner’s argument of inquiry matches all the elements that an academic discourse community would like to see. He supports his argument (which in these first six pages is essentially that “more systematic testing” must be done) by doing a bunch of research on previous surveys on this subject, while at the same time showcasing his extensive knowledge (and coverage) of the other arguments in this debate, and their reasoning (including their over-use of narratives as evidence). However with his research he concludes that this previous work needs more testing so that the resolution to the larger conversation can be concluded.
