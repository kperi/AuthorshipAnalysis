
      The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states, “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech.” Just as the founding fathers of this country strongly believed that freedom of speech is a natural right, so do I. A government should not censor its people from fear of what its subjects have to say because if a government is capable of being toppled because of some speeches, then that it is not a government deserving to stay in power. 
      Consequently, the notion of censoring the media seems to me, unjust; however, I must admit that there should be certain exceptions to this right of free speech, in order for a more civil society. In agreement with the U.S. constitution, I believe that if a media is “inciting imminent lawless action” (a.k.a. someone giving a speech calling for a mob to burn down the library), that media can be censored. Also the government should be able censor media directed as a serious threat toward an audience or media intended to instill objectively false ideas in its audience in order to ruin the reputation of someone or something (libel and slander laws). Finally, media containing information that will endanger the lives of people if it becomes publically known, such as military secrets, should be censored . Nevertheless, prejudiced/racist media, such as “x group of people are inferior and deserve x”, should not be censored as long as they don’t fall under any of the above exceptions.
      Although I may not agree with all of the U.S. government’s executions of the Constitutional rules on the exceptions of free speech, I believe that the exceptions laid out by our Constitution are, in general, very accurate. As a result, I assert that, in certain cases, media should be censored for the benefit of society.
