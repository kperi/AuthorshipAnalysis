I don't mind his bragging and gloating. To me, he recognizes the importance of his home and places it higher in his choice, that's enough.
Free cup cake @ 1 pm. But didn't wait for it.
Tzuchi Ju this is the best garden I've visited in the recent years. Have you been here? It's close to your house.
Sree Kaka did you really just write Chinese to me
Anne is my brother's daughter. Today is her birthday. Luckily it's not on the same day of the class reunion so I was able to celebrate with her after meeting some friends at Taipei.

A friend from my middle school joined NTU1984 (NTU1984 is a close facebook group). Then through her facebook profile, I saw some familiar names. Most of all, I found the ringleader who already have a collection of our high school classmates. I am mostly grateful that they didn't forget about me.
Jennifer, thank you! I think they make me so happy. And when you are happy, it makes everything much easier.
Tzuchi Ju Did you come when I was at Purdue? I know you visited when I was at MA, and what a host I was - I let you read my for days! Boys! You should come visiting more!
Haha. Just to take the pictures on the beautiful wintery scene without slow down or blocking the traffic.
