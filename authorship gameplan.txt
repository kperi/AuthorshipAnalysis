TODO 
need to get list of stylometric features.. pretty much done
need to split into training sets and test sets.. going to have to wait on this one
need to group by author.. same as above

then we can get frequencies of stylometric features by author (make.table.of.frequencies) but with smart data manipulation to account for things like uppercase stylometric patterns
